PUBLISHED: July 13, 2018 at 12:28 pm | UPDATED: July 14, 2018 at 10:54 pm

A plan to keep open roughly 300,000 acres of Southern California desert for off-road vehicle use — a land area nearly as big as Los Angeles — and preserve hundreds of thousands of other acres is being considered in the Senate after being approved last month by the U.S. House of Representatives.


Sponsored by Rep. Paul Cook, R-Yucca Valley, the California Off-Road Recreation and Conservation Act has the support of San Bernardino and Inyo counties along with off-road vehicle and some environmental groups. But the Sierra Club has concerns about the bill.


Cook represents Inyo and Mono counties along with desert and mountaintop communities in San Bernardino County, including Adelanto, Apple Valley, Big Bear City and Lake Arrowhead. About 90 percent of Cook’s district is federal land, and the goal of his proposal is to balance conservation concerns with off-roaders’ desire to roam vast stretches of Southern California landscape, said Tim Itnyre, Cook’s legislative director.

“Land suitable for conservation should typically be managed as part of a desert park or wilderness. Similarly, lands appropriate for energy generation and economic development should not be encumbered with conservation designations such as ‘wilderness study areas,’” Itnyre said.


“Additionally, popular off-highway vehicle recreation areas should be given the same sort of protections in law that are granted to conservation areas to prevent arbitrary closures. (The bill) attempts to solve these problems by setting aside land for conservation and off-road recreation, while releasing wilderness study areas that have been found unsuitable for a wilderness designation.”


‘It’s taken away’


Cook introduced a similar bill in 2015. A year later, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., offered similar legislation, creating 142,000 acres of off-highway recreation areas around three national monuments in the Mojave Desert created by President Barack Obama.


Cook objected to Obama’s monument designations, which totaled 1.8 million acres. His 2015 bill would have allowed new mining claims, expanded off-roading areas, and made Mojave Trails National Monument a less-restrictive special management area.


Co-sponsored by Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Redlands, the 2018 bill that passed the House by a voice vote strips out “controversial provisions” from Cook’s earlier proposal and Feinstein’s bill, including restrictions on desert groundwater use and incentives to boost large-scale renewable energy projects, Itnyre said.

The bill establishes or expands six off-highway vehicle recreation areas, including Johnson Valley in San Bernardino County, and includes language to keep those areas open.


“With the increasing popularity of the sport, (off-highway vehicle) users deserve to have lands set aside without worry that a bureaucrat or president will unilaterally close the area for questionable reasons,” Itnyre said.


Loren Campbell of Palm Desert, who serves on the board of Inland Empire 4 Wheelrs, said federal land that could be open to off-roading is often off-limits.


“The use is allowed by permission … (but) the permission is never granted,” Campbell said. “It’s taken away, the right to enjoy the land, but it’s never given back.”


The bill also designates about 18,000 acres of federal land as the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area. The move would restrict large-scale solar and wind energy projects while preserving other commercial and recreational uses.


Another 39,000 acres would be added to the National Park System, including “significant acreage at both Joshua Tree National Park and Death Valley National Park,” read a news release from Cook’s office. The bill also designates 329,000 acres as wilderness, according to Itnyre.


‘Too much’


While the California Wilderness Coalition supports the bill, the Sierra Club believes too much land is set aside for off-roading.

“Every acre of federal land that’s open to new off-highway vehicle use is too much,” said Athan Manuel, director of the club’s Land Protection Program. “There’s no shortage of trails on public and private land. There’s no shortage of places to ride.”


Off-roading can damage grasslands and wetlands and cause noise and air pollution, Manuel said. “We’re not trying to shut down existing off-highway vehicle areas. But we don’t want to see any new areas open up.”


Campbell said his club spends 1,500 hours a year preserving the trails it uses. Itnyre said off-roading is a multi-million dollar industry that supports thousands of jobs.


The bill’s strong bipartisan showing in the House “should give it some momentum” in the Senate, Itnyre said.


“The fact that the Senate is scheduled to be in session through the end of August should expand the window for a hearing and a vote this year,” Itnyre said. “While passing anything through the Senate can be challenging, Rep. Cook is optimistic that (the bill) has a real chance of being enacted this year.”


BY THE NUMBERS


The California Off-Road Recreation and Conservation Act, sponsored by Rep. Paul Cook, R-Yucca Valley, passed the House last month and awaits action in the Senate.


Here are the numbers behind the bill:


329,000 – The amount of acreage to be designated as wilderness under the bill.


300,000 – The bill would establish or expand six off-highway vehicle recreation areas in the California desert totaling about 300,000 acres. These areas could not be closed administratively.


39,000 – The number of acres the bill would add to the National Park System.


18,000 – The number of acres of existing federal land that would go into the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area. That would restrict large-scale renewable energy projects on the land while preserving existing recreational and commercial uses.


CORRECTION, 7/13/2018: The California Off-Road Recreation and Conservation Act designates 329,000 acres as wilderness. Due to a reporting error, an earlier version of the story omitted this amount.

PUBLISHED: July 14, 2018 at 9:21 pm | UPDATED: July 15, 2018 at 6:09 pm

The California Democratic Party handed Sen. Dianne Feinstein a striking rejection on Saturday, as party leaders endorsed her progressive challenger Kevin de León.


The endorsement, voted on by the state party’s executive board at a meeting in Oakland, gives De León a big morale boost as he faces an uphill race against the 26-year incumbent.


De León, a state senator from Los Angeles and the former leader of the state Senate, won 65 percent of the 333 delegates, according to the party. Feinstein netted 7 percent after urging her supporters to choose no endorsement “in the name of party unity.”


De León appealed to the party faithful by blasting President Donald Trump and embracing policies like single-payer health care and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, while tapping into discontentment with Feinstein among the party’s left flank.


“Today’s vote is a clear-eyed rejection of politics as usual in Washington, D.C.,” De León said in a statement. “The nation’s most accomplished Democratic Party is leading the call for a new generation of leadership who will fight to advance a bold agenda.”


Pro-De León activists erupted in cheers at Oakland’s Marriott City Center hotel as rumors leaked out about his victory Saturday evening.


“It shows that California Democrats expect strong progressive stances from our legislators,” said David Atkins, a delegate from Santa Barbara, between hugs with his fellow De León supporters. “We’re part of a movement in this party.”

Still, Feinstein remains a strong favorite for November — she won 44 percent in the June top-two primary to De León’s 12 percent, and has a sizable fundraising advantage.


“The reality here is that he got beat by over 30 points,” said Bill Carrick, Feinstein’s longtime strategist. “We should move on beyond the primary fights and try to win elections against Republicans.”


The endorsement means De León will be able to raise funds in coordination with the party and be featured in Democratic mailers. It will also likely net him a wave of national attention and donations.


Feinstein, who at 82 is the oldest current U.S. senator, had been calling in political favors in recent weeks to argue for a no endorsement vote. Her campaign sent a letter to executive board members from a half dozen of the party’s House candidates in key California seats asking leaders to abstain from supporting Feinstein or De León.


Neither Feinstein nor De León won the endorsement in the primary campaign at the Democratic convention in February, where De León got the support of 54 percent of the delegates — just under the 60 percent threshold necessary to win the endorsement.


De León’s endorsement coup echoes other wins for progressives in recent weeks, including New York candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who electrified liberals by defeating the number-four Democrat in the House of Representatives last month.


The contrast between the two candidates was on show as they rushed between caucus meetings on Saturday.


“Seniority matters,” Feinstein told her supporters over a breakfast of bacon and eggs, reminding them that she was the top Democrat on the Senate committee that will hold hearings on President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.


“This man will be the deciding vote on those things we hold most dear,” including the Roe v. Wade decision, she said. She said she and her committee would review “over one million pieces of paper” of Kavanaugh’s past opinions and other documents about his record, in an attempt to make a case against his nomination.


But De León argued that the hearings Feinstein is preparing for shouldn’t even take place.


“We need to shut the Senate down and never allow this individual to come to the Senate floor,” he declared to cheers at another caucus meeting later that morning. “What’s at stake is a generation of power, decisions that will affect each and every one of us.”


De León’s campaign argued that his connections with party activists will help him in the endorsement face-off, while Feinstein has invested less time in recent years engaging party activists.


“These are relationships he’s been building for 10 years or longer,” said Jonathan Underland, a De León spokesman, said this week. “The idea that he is trying to divide the party is just laughable.”


The Democrats walking the halls in Oakland are fired up over Trump and optimistic about their chances to take back the House in November. The most popular figure here has been Rep. Maxine Waters, who’s been attacked by the president after encouraging protests against him and his staffers. She won huge cheers when she declared Saturday that Trump was “embarrassing us every day.”

The Senate race remains the biggest sticking point, splitting Democrats over questions of liberal bona fides and generational leadership.


“You don’t need to replace someone who’s doing their job,” said labor rights organizer Dolores Huerta, who sat next to Feinstein at her breakfast. “Why do you want to go in there and divide the party?”

But De León’s backers said they were ready for a more progressive vision as the Golden State faces down the Trump administration. “I appreciate everything Dianne’s done for the state, but it’s time for some new blood and new values,” said David Weiner, a delegate from Palm Springs.


Feinstein has clashed with the state party faithful before, losing the Democratic endorsement in campaigns for governor and U.S. Senate in 1990 and 1992. In 1990, she dramatically declared her support for the death penalty at the state convention, over loud boos from the hall — and then her campaign cut an ad featuring the footage to show her independence.


In a sign of how Feinstein has moved to the left as she faces De León’s, she said earlier this year that she now opposes capital punishment.

“The folks who show up at Democratic executive board meetings have never been Dianne Feinstein’s base,” said Darry Sragow, a strategist who ran Feinstein’s 1990 campaign and isn’t working for either camp this year. “[De León] gaining the endorsement is not going to get him the votes he needs to win — but it’ll be an opportunity to put a point on the board when he has very few of those.”

* Cars in a line at night under red street light. Cars parked at night. generic
By Jim Radcliffe | jradcliffe@scng.com | Orange County Register

PUBLISHED: July 14, 2018 at 6:01 am | UPDATED: July 14, 2018 at 9:48 pm

Q. Honk, can I park on the street and block my own driveway? In my area, I get a lot of apartment and condo visitors parking on the street in front of my house. I put up with it, but it would be nice if they wouldn’t do it on Thanksgiving and Christmas. Those two days really bother me, especially when it is in regard to my immediate neighbors. What your mom once told you is right on: People should be courteous and, if possible, park in front of their friends’ homes when visiting.


– Jim Fuchs, Santa Ana


A. As tempting as it is, Jim, try not to park in front of your driveway.


Cpl. Anthony Bertagna, the spokesman for Santa Ana P.D., said that under the law you cannot park blocking even your own driveway.


“However, as with all tickets, it is at the discretion of the handling officer,” the good corporal said. “Often, if it is at the owner’s residence, they do not cite and just advise them of the law.”


That law, by the way, is from the Califoirnia Vehicle Code, so it covers the entire Golden State.


Q. Honk, the sign below a freeway on-ramp traffic-control light often reads, “One car per green.” Can I take the signage literally – one car per green? Let’s say I am the only car on the ramp and I see green, but it turns red again before I can get there. Can I just continue through without stopping?


– Susan Posilovich, Irvine


A. No.


The point of those ramp meters is to even out the flow of traffic on the freeway, so Honk gets your logic.


But the law is strict: You can only go on a green, even if there was no motorist before you on the ramp for 10 minutes. And the green is so short, don’t try rolling up to it and timing it.


Just stop and wait.


“You are going to treat it like any other red light,” said Duane Graham, an officer and spokesman for the California Highway Patrol out of the agency’s Westminster station house.


Susan, you are obviously asking about this because you want to do the right thing. Plenty of motorists, though, just blow through those red lights knowing they are breaking the law.


Nabbing such cheaters probably isn’t high on most CHP officers’ lists of biggest concerns. But there is a device out there to help them get those who don’t bother stopping when the meter lights are on.


On the backsides of a few ramp meters are lights that allow officers downstream to tell if the meter light is red or green. The cops, in their black-and-whites farther down the ramp pointed toward the freeway, can eyeball the driver and the light in their rear-view mirrors. When a violation occurs, they just drop behind the offenders and pull them over.


That device’s name? A tattletale light.


Honkin’ fact: When a 2-year-old boy died in a hot car in Sacramento over the weekend, it was the 57th time in California a child has died in a hot car since 1990, according to kidsandccars.org, an advocacy group. Each year, the organization says, an average of 37 children die in hot cars in the United States.

X-Games rider Travis Pastrana celebrated the legacy of Evel Knievel on Sunday, July 8, 2018, by nailing three of Knievel’s most iconic jumps in Las Vegas, Nevada. The first jump was to clear 52 cars at 120 feet. The second jump was 16 Greyhound buses at 155 feet. The final jump was the famous fountains at Caesar’s Palace at 141 feet. Pastrana used a V-twin motorcycle similar to what Evel used, the Indian Scout FTR750.


He practiced for the jumps in the Inland Empire.

The statistical geeks at WalletHub, Bankrate and Kiplinger’s recently took their respective shots at measuring how each state compares in terms of livability factors for your retirement years: from costs to culture to that critical aging issue, healthcare.


Let’s politely say the conclusions varied.


So who’s correct? Who do you trust? Retirement choices are no small matter.


Let me take a literal middle ground by considering their collective wisdom. As a public service, my trusty spreadsheet helped me combine this trio of retirement location rankings to give a better picture of the varying strengths vs. weaknesses of the states.


I reassembled their published ranking data — overall scores, subindex grades and related data — into three evenly weighted metrics: costs (buying power); character (culture and climate); and care (healthcare and healthiness). What did I learn?


Florida is the place to retire, statistically speaking to my composite index. It ranked No. 1 for costs and character. But if you don’t care for humidity, and enjoy winter’s chill, No. 2 was South Dakota, which enjoyed No. 4 grades for costs and care.


Third-ranked was New Hampshire (No. 4 for character; 10th-best for care), then Virginia: (ninth-best for character) and Hawaii (No. 40 for costs but No. 1 for care!)


Conversely, don’t think about Louisiana for your golden years, according to my math. It ranked last in my reassembled scorecard. Why? No. 49 for character and No. 50 for care.


Next worst score was Arkansas (No. 47 for character), then came Kentucky (No. 47 for care); New Mexico (No. 46 for character) and Illinois (No. 41 for care).


What about California? By my math, the Golden State ranked a middle-of-the-pack 26th for one’s golden years. California’s seventh-worst ranking for costs was improved by a No. 16 grade for character and No. 18 for care.


Here is how the 50 states ranked as retirement options in order of my overall scoring then broken down by ranking for cost, character and care quality.

Rank State          Cost Character Care
1    Florida        1    1         2   
2    South Dakota   4    20        1   
3    New Hampshire  22   4         3   
4    Virginia       18   9         6   
5    Hawaii         40   8         12  
6    Utah           7    33        4

Next worst score was Arkansas (No. 47 for character), then came Kentucky (No. 47 for care); New Mexico (No. 46 for character) and Illinois (No. 41 for care).


What about California? By my math, the Golden State ranked a middle-of-the-pack 26th for one’s golden years. California’s seventh-worst ranking for costs was improved by a No. 16 grade for character and No. 18 for care.


Here is how the 50 states ranked as retirement options in order of my overall scoring then broken down by ranking for cost, character and care quality.

The statistical geeks at WalletHub, Bankrate and Kiplinger’s recently took their respective shots at measuring how each state compares in terms of livability factors for your retirement years: from costs to culture to that critical aging issue, healthcare.


Let’s politely say the conclusions varied.


So who’s correct? Who do you trust? Retirement choices are no small matter.


Let me take a literal middle ground by considering their collective wisdom. As a public service, my trusty spreadsheet helped me combine this trio of retirement location rankings to give a better picture of the varying strengths vs. weaknesses of the states.


I reassembled their published ranking data — overall scores, subindex grades and related data — into three evenly weighted metrics: costs (buying power); character (culture and climate); and care (healthcare and healthiness). What did I learn?


Florida is the place to retire, statistically speaking to my composite index. It ranked No. 1 for costs and character. But if you don’t care for humidity, and enjoy winter’s chill, No. 2 was South Dakota, which enjoyed No. 4 grades for costs and care.


Third-ranked was New Hampshire (No. 4 for character; 10th-best for care), then Virginia: (ninth-best for character) and Hawaii (No. 40 for costs but No. 1 for care!)


Conversely, don’t think about Louisiana for your golden years, according to my math. It ranked last in my reassembled scorecard. Why? No. 49 for character and No. 50 for care.


Next worst score was Arkansas (No. 47 for character), then came Kentucky (No. 47 for care); New Mexico (No. 46 for character) and Illinois (No. 41 for care).


What about California? By my math, the Golden State ranked a middle-of-the-pack 26th for one’s golden years. California’s seventh-worst ranking for costs was improved by a No. 16 grade for character and No. 18 for care.


Here is how the 50 states ranked as retirement options in order of my overall scoring then broken down by ranking for cost, character and care quality.

Rank State          Cost Character Care
1    Florida        1    1         2   
2    South Dakota   4    20        1   
3    New Hampshire  22   4         3   
4    Virginia       18   9         6   
5    Hawaii         40   8         12  
6    Utah           7    33        4   
7    Montana        18   18        12

The statistical geeks at WalletHub, Bankrate and Kiplinger’s recently took their respective shots at measuring how each state compares in terms of livability factors for your retirement years: from costs to culture to that critical aging issue, healthcare.


Let’s politely say the conclusions varied.


So who’s correct? Who do you trust? Retirement choices are no small matter.


Let me take a literal middle ground by considering their collective wisdom. As a public service, my trusty spreadsheet helped me combine this trio of retirement location rankings to give a better picture of the varying strengths vs. weaknesses of the states.


I reassembled their published ranking data — overall scores, subindex grades and related data — into three evenly weighted metrics: costs (buying power); character (culture and climate); and care (healthcare and healthiness). What did I learn?


Florida is the place to retire, statistically speaking to my composite index. It ranked No. 1 for costs and character. But if you don’t care for humidity, and enjoy winter’s chill, No. 2 was South Dakota, which enjoyed No. 4 grades for costs and care.


Third-ranked was New Hampshire (No. 4 for character; 10th-best for care), then Virginia: (ninth-best for character) and Hawaii (No. 40 for costs but No. 1 for care!)


Conversely, don’t think about Louisiana for your golden years, according to my math. It ranked last in my reassembled scorecard. Why? No. 49 for character and No. 50 for care.


Next worst score was Arkansas (No. 47 for character), then came Kentucky (No. 47 for care); New Mexico (No. 46 for character) and Illinois (No. 41 for care).


What about California? By my math, the Golden State ranked a middle-of-the-pack 26th for one’s golden years. California’s seventh-worst ranking for costs was improved by a No. 16 grade for character and No. 18 for care.


Here is how the 50 states ranked as retirement options in order of my overall scoring then broken down by ranking for cost, character and care quality.

Rank State          Cost Character Care
1    Florida        1    1         2   
2    South Dakota   4    20        1   
3    New Hampshire  22   4         3   
4    Virginia       18   9         6   
5    Hawaii         40   8         12  
6    Utah           7    33        4   
7    Montana        18   18        12  
8    Massachusetts  34   4         29

MORENO VALLEY — A wild burro was shot with an arrow, but eluded rescue efforts Wednesday.


Riverside County Department of Animal Services spokesman John Welsh said the feral donkey was wounded over the weekend, and a concerned resident posted images of the animal to social media, catching the attention of authorities.


Welsh described the attack on the burro as a “terrible act of cruelty” that left the animal in need of veterinary care.


The burro was spotted in the Reche Canyon area, in the vicinity of the Black Stallion Ranch, north of Moreno Valley, and animal control officers went to the location Wednesday afternoon, Welsh said.


“We shot it with two tranquilizer darts, but efforts to capture the wild burro were unsuccessful,” Welsh said. “The darts should have been enough, and we are uncertain why they were not effective.


“It could have been a result of the animal being worked up earlier, prior to our arrival,” he said.


The arrow was no longer protruding from the creature when the darts were injected, but the wound was still visible, according to Welsh


Officers will return to the area Thursday morning to have another go at corralling the burro.


Welsh said the nonprofit DonkeyLand rescue organization has been alerted and will be enlisted to assist.


Officials asked anyone with information regarding who might have injured the donkey to contact the Department of Animal Services at (951) 358-7387.


Herds of wild burros populate the Pigeon Pass and Reche Canyon areas between Moreno Valley and Colton. Riverside County Ordinance No. 934 makes it unlawful to feed, pet or otherwise draw the donkeys toward roadsides and other locations where they might be hurt — or wander into traffic and cause accidents.

MORENO VALLEY — A wild burro was shot with an arrow, but eluded rescue efforts Wednesday.


Riverside County Department of Animal Services spokesman John Welsh said the feral donkey was wounded over the weekend, and a concerned resident posted images of the animal to social media, catching the attention of authorities.


Welsh described the attack on the burro as a “terrible act of cruelty” that left the animal in need of veterinary care.


The burro was spotted in the Reche Canyon area, in the vicinity of the Black Stallion Ranch, north of Moreno Valley, and animal control officers went to the location Wednesday afternoon, Welsh said.


“We shot it with two tranquilizer darts, but efforts to capture the wild burro were unsuccessful,” Welsh said. “The darts should have been enough, and we are uncertain why they were not effective.


“It could have been a result of the animal being worked up earlier, prior to our arrival,” he said.


The arrow was no longer protruding from the creature when the darts were injected, but the wound was still visible, according to Welsh


Officers will return to the area Thursday morning to have another go at corralling the burro.


Welsh said the nonprofit DonkeyLand rescue organization has been alerted and will be enlisted to assist.


Officials asked anyone with information regarding who might have injured the donkey to contact the Department of Animal Services at (951) 358-7387.


Herds of wild burros populate the Pigeon Pass and Reche Canyon areas between Moreno Valley and Colton. Riverside County Ordinance No. 934 makes it unlawful to feed, pet or otherwise draw the donkeys toward roadsides and other locations where they might be hurt — or wander into traffic and cause accidents.

* The series created by Sherwood Schwartz include “The Brady Bunch.” Schwartz died Tuesday, July 12, 2011, at age 94.
By City News Service |

PUBLISHED: July 19, 2018 at 12:19 am | UPDATED: July 19, 2018 at 12:35 am

The Studio City home used as the exterior for the home of “The Brady Bunch” is on the market for the first time in nearly 50 years, a real estate agent announced Wednesday.


The two-bedroom, three-bathroom house in the 11200 block of Dilling Street, adjacent to the Los Angeles River, is listed for $1.885 million, according to Ernie Carswell, a Douglas Elliman agent who is listing what he said “is reportedly the second most photographed home in the United States after the White House.”


The home’s interior does not match what was shown in the 1969-74 ABC series because those scenes were filmed at Paramount Studios, Carswell told the Los Angeles Times.


Several homes in the neighborhood have been demolished recently. The owners will give first consideration to bidders who want to keep the home intact, Carswell told The Times.


“We’re not going to accept the first big offer from a developer who wants to tear it down,” Carswell told The Times. “We’re going to wait a few days, in case there are others who want to purchase it as an investment to preserve it.”

The Studio City home used as the exterior for the home of “The Brady Bunch” is on the market for the first time in nearly 50 years, a real estate agent announced Wednesday.


The two-bedroom, three-bathroom house in the 11200 block of Dilling Street, adjacent to the Los Angeles River, is listed for $1.885 million, according to Ernie Carswell, a Douglas Elliman agent who is listing what he said “is reportedly the second most photographed home in the United States after the White House.”


The home’s interior does not match what was shown in the 1969-74 ABC series because those scenes were filmed at Paramount Studios, Carswell told the Los Angeles Times.


Several homes in the neighborhood have been demolished recently. The owners will give first consideration to bidders who want to keep the home intact, Carswell told The Times.


“We’re not going to accept the first big offer from a developer who wants to tear it down,” Carswell told The Times. “We’re going to wait a few days, in case there are others who want to purchase it as an investment to preserve it.”

PUBLISHED: July 19, 2018 at 12:02 am | UPDATED: July 19, 2018 at 12:05 am

MURRIETA — A man whose illegal drug manufacturing operation triggered a fire in Wildomar that destroyed a home and damaged another, leaving him with burn injuries, was sentenced Wednesday to three years in state prison.


Bracken Blucher pleaded guilty in May to manufacturing illegal drugs, causing a fire that resulted in property damage and a sentence-enhancing allegation of causing damage to multiple structures in a fire.


A home in the 33000 block of East Harvest Way in Wildomar was destroyed early Wednesday, July 19, 2017, in an explosion and fire that also sent one person to the hospital and damaged a neighboring house. Sheriff’s officials were investigating whether an illegal drug lab producing “honey oil” was to blame. (Photo by Frank Bellino, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG)

A Riverside County Superior Court judge certified the plea terms and imposed the sentence recommended by the Department of Probation.


The judge additionally ordered Blucher to pay victim restitution in an amount that will be determined by the agency.


Blucher was in the process of making a marijuana derivative known as “honey oil” in the predawn hours of July 19, 2017, when his residence erupted in flames from a butane gas explosion.


The blaze on Harvest Way, near Cornstalk Road, was reported at 4 a.m.


According to county fire officials, a 1,200-square foot modular home was consumed by the conflagration, and a neighboring single-story residence was moderately damaged.


Blucher suffered minor to moderate burns that required emergency treatment.


Investigators found butane gas cannisters scattered throughout the street and yard fronting the property where the fire started.

Seven engine crews and a truck company, numbering about 30 personnel, spent nearly an hour battling the flames before they were fully contained.


Three people living in the modular home with Blucher were displaced. Three adults and a child from the neighboring property required temporary lodgings.


Ironically, the blaze occurred one day after the District Attorney’s Office released a series of public service announcements warning of the perils of butane honey oil production.


The videos featured Alex Gonzales and his girlfriend Selina Cervantes, both of whom were severely burned in a butane honey oil blaze at a Palm Springs motel in February 2015. Cervantes suffered second- and third-degree burns to 97 percent of her body and was permanently disfigured.


“People need to understand that the butane honey oil extraction process takes lives — it hurts people forever,” District Attorney Mike Hestrin said before unveiling the public service announcements. “We want to put an end to the manufacture of butane honey oil.”Drug lab operators use butane to extract tincture from cannabis plants. The product, often referred to as “wax” or hash, can be mixed with anything and bottled.


Butane honey oil labs have sprung up in both remote and heavily populated areas of the county. In the past few years, butane honey oil fires have erupted in Cathedral City, Moreno Valley, Murrieta, Norco and Riverside.

PUBLISHED: July 19, 2018 at 12:02 am | UPDATED: July 19, 2018 at 12:05 am

MURRIETA — A man whose illegal drug manufacturing operation triggered a fire in Wildomar that destroyed a home and damaged another, leaving him with burn injuries, was sentenced Wednesday to three years in state prison.


Bracken Blucher pleaded guilty in May to manufacturing illegal drugs, causing a fire that resulted in property damage and a sentence-enhancing allegation of causing damage to multiple structures in a fire.


A home in the 33000 block of East Harvest Way in Wildomar was destroyed early Wednesday, July 19, 2017, in an explosion and fire that also sent one person to the hospital and damaged a neighboring house. Sheriff’s officials were investigating whether an illegal drug lab producing “honey oil” was to blame. (Photo by Frank Bellino, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG)

A Riverside County Superior Court judge certified the plea terms and imposed the sentence recommended by the Department of Probation.


The judge additionally ordered Blucher to pay victim restitution in an amount that will be determined by the agency.


Blucher was in the process of making a marijuana derivative known as “honey oil” in the predawn hours of July 19, 2017, when his residence erupted in flames from a butane gas explosion.


The blaze on Harvest Way, near Cornstalk Road, was reported at 4 a.m.


According to county fire officials, a 1,200-square foot modular home was consumed by the conflagration, and a neighboring single-story residence was moderately damaged.


Blucher suffered minor to moderate burns that required emergency treatment.


Investigators found butane gas cannisters scattered throughout the street and yard fronting the property where the fire started.

Seven engine crews and a truck company, numbering about 30 personnel, spent nearly an hour battling the flames before they were fully contained.


Three people living in the modular home with Blucher were displaced. Three adults and a child from the neighboring property required temporary lodgings.


Ironically, the blaze occurred one day after the District Attorney’s Office released a series of public service announcements warning of the perils of butane honey oil production.


The videos featured Alex Gonzales and his girlfriend Selina Cervantes, both of whom were severely burned in a butane honey oil blaze at a Palm Springs motel in February 2015. Cervantes suffered second- and third-degree burns to 97 percent of her body and was permanently disfigured.


“People need to understand that the butane honey oil extraction process takes lives — it hurts people forever,” District Attorney Mike Hestrin said before unveiling the public service announcements. “We want to put an end to the manufacture of butane honey oil.”Drug lab operators use butane to extract tincture from cannabis plants. The product, often referred to as “wax” or hash, can be mixed with anything and bottled.


Butane honey oil labs have sprung up in both remote and heavily populated areas of the county. In the past few years, butane honey oil fires have erupted in Cathedral City, Moreno Valley, Murrieta, Norco and Riverside.

A Riverside gun store owner has posted a video that appears to show actor Sacha Baron Cohen — disguised as a “Hungarian immigrant” — getting caught as he attempts to dupe the store’s employees.


(The link below is to a video with explicit language.)


Warrior One Guns And Ammo posted the video on its Facebook page Tuesday, July 17, just after Cohen released the first episode of his new satirical show “Who Is America?“


The episode features Cohen, disguised as an Israeli gun-rights activist, tricking current and former Republican congressmen and gun lobbyists into appearing to endorse a program to arm school children as young as 4.


It looks like Cohen wanted to do the same in Riverside — but failed — the owner said on Facebook.


“yeah we don’t play that …” they wrote on Facebook. “This was an attempt to make gun owners in California look like racist gun toting crazy people.”


The video shows a camera crew and a man with a long beard and tight pants walking into the store on the northern end of the city as owner Norris Sweidan and employees narrate the security camera footage.


“Right there, I was like your accent is fake as (expletive),” Sweidan says in the video. “And those leather pants!”


Soon after, Sweidan says, “You’re Borat,” referring to Cohen’s character from a 2006 mockumentary. The man and his camera crew then quickly leave.

The video doesn’t appear to have been posted online before Tuesday. The first episode of the show aired Sunday, July 15 on Showtime.


Employees at the store, 2222 Kansas Ave., were buzzing about the experience and rewatching the video Wednesday, July 18. But they said official comment would have to come from Sweidan, who said he wasn’t available Wednesday because he’d been swamped with phone calls in the wake of the video’s release.


Showtime’s vice president of entertainment public relations, Nicole Elice, said the network had no comment. Cohen couldn’t be reached.

The targets of the first episode include U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Costa Mesa.


Rohrbacher said his comments were unfairly edited.


The Riverside incident caught the attention of gun rights figures, including NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch, whose Twitter post about it was retweeted more than 3,000 times and liked nearly 8,000 times as of Wednesday evening.

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 8:46 am | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 10:23 pm

Five men police call gang members have been charged in the San Bernardino shooting death of a wife of a Mexican Mafia member, authorities said on Wednesday, adding that the killing was orchestrated behind bars and one of the accused has since been slain.


The Jan. 18, 2017 death of Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez, 41, of North Hills was planned by the five defendants — three of whom were in the state prison system while the plot came together — said authorities, who have not disclosed a possible motive for the killing. While the charges don’t name the alleged shooter or shooters, one defendant is charged with being a felon in possession of a handgun the night of the shooting.


The victim was previously identified by authorities as Carmen Gutierrez Rodriguez.


The complaint filed in the case said the slaying was “for the benefit, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang,” and was done to further criminal conduct by gang members. It also accuses the defendants of street terrorism.


The victim’s husband, convicted armed robber Andrew Rodriguez, identified by police as a Mexican Mafia prison gang member, died three months after her slaying, at Pelican Bay State Prison, on April 20, 2017. His death remains under investigation as suspicious, police said.


On July 11, the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office quietly filed murder charges against the five accused gang members, with one, Eric Moreno, 30, killed just days later in his cell on Sunday in Kern Valley State Prison. Police declined to comment Wednesday on a motive in Moreno’s death. His cellmate, also from San Bernardino County, was named by prison officials as a suspect.

The arrests and charges in the woman’s murder case were the result of an investigation by a multi-agency task force formed after the slaying, San Bernardino police said in a statement.


Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez, a mother of five, was shot to death in a parking lot outside a cafe in the 1600 block of North Mt. Vernon Avenue.


Her husband was a member of the San Bernardino-based Westside Verdugo gang before being inducted into the Mexican Mafia while in prison, police said. He was serving a 115-years-to-life, three-strike armed-robbery sentence, records show.


Besides Moreno, those charged in Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez’s slaying were Isaac Aguirre, 44; Robert Fernandez, 43; Richard Garcia, 45; and Matthew Manzano, 35.


Police said Moreno, Garcia and Manzano were in California prisons when the slaying was planned and carried out, and the two still alive remain in prison custody.


Manzano was sentenced in San Bernardino County Superior Court in 2010 to two consecutive life-without-parole terms for the deaths of two men in 2005.


Moreno was sentenced in San Bernardino County Superior Court to 10 years in prison April 22, 2015 on his guilty plea to possession of a firearm by a felon and the enhancement of participation in a street gang, court records show.


State prison officials said Moreno’s cellmate, Daniel Olguin, 36, and also from San Bernardino County, is the suspect in Moreno’s death. Olguin was sentenced in 2017 to life-with-the-possibility of parole for his role, with two others, of murder, torture and false imprisonment in a 2005 death.


Garcia was sentenced to life without parole on April 21, 1998 in San Bernardino County Superior Court on a murder case, court records show. Aguirre and Fernandez are now in local custody, the police statement said. Aguirre is accused of both murder and being a felon in possession of a handgun the night of the shooting.


Court records show both men have pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges in connection with the Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez slaying.


Four of the men charged in the murder were identified as members of the Westside Verdugo gang, police said, while Manzano is from an unidentified Redlands gang. Police said the gangs are obedient or submissive to the Mexican Mafia’s orders from prison.


The task force’s effort, “Operation Green Hand,” also resulted in 86 other arrests on suspicion of various weapons, conspiracy, auto theft and narcotics charges. Those arrests were announced last year.


“The purpose of this task force was to target gang members in prison whom were attempting to influence the local street gangs of San Bernardino in addition to identify those who were involved in the murder of Carmen Rodriguez,” the police statement said.


Agencies involved in the task force include the San Bernardino Police Department’s Homicide Unit, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, Fontana police, the FBI; the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the California Highway Patrol and the state Department of Justice.

The complaint filed in the case said the slaying was “for the benefit, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang,” and was done to further criminal conduct by gang members. It also accuses the defendants of street terrorism.


The victim’s husband, convicted armed robber Andrew Rodriguez, identified by police as a Mexican Mafia prison gang member, died three months after her slaying, at Pelican Bay State Prison, on April 20, 2017. His death remains under investigation as suspicious, police said.


On July 11, the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office quietly filed murder charges against the five accused gang members, with one, Eric Moreno, 30, killed just days later in his cell on Sunday in Kern Valley State Prison. Police declined to comment Wednesday on a motive in Moreno’s death. His cellmate, also from San Bernardino County, was named by prison officials as a suspect.

The arrests and charges in the woman’s murder case were the result of an investigation by a multi-agency task force formed after the slaying, San Bernardino police said in a statement.


Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez, a mother of five, was shot to death in a parking lot outside a cafe in the 1600 block of North Mt. Vernon Avenue.


Her husband was a member of the San Bernardino-based Westside Verdugo gang before being inducted into the Mexican Mafia while in prison, police said. He was serving a 115-years-to-life, three-strike armed-robbery sentence, records show.


Besides Moreno, those charged in Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez’s slaying were Isaac Aguirre, 44; Robert Fernandez, 43; Richard Garcia, 45; and Matthew Manzano, 35.


Police said Moreno, Garcia and Manzano were in California prisons when the slaying was planned and carried out, and the two still alive remain in prison custody.


Manzano was sentenced in San Bernardino County Superior Court in 2010 to two consecutive life-without-parole terms for the deaths of two men in 2005.


Moreno was sentenced in San Bernardino County Superior Court to 10 years in prison April 22, 2015 on his guilty plea to possession of a firearm by a felon and the enhancement of participation in a street gang, court records show.


State prison officials said Moreno’s cellmate, Daniel Olguin, 36, and also from San Bernardino County, is the suspect in Moreno’s death. Olguin was sentenced in 2017 to life-with-the-possibility of parole for his role, with two others, of murder, torture and false imprisonment in a 2005 death.


Garcia was sentenced to life without parole on April 21, 1998 in San Bernardino County Superior Court on a murder case, court records show. Aguirre and Fernandez are now in local custody, the police statement said. Aguirre is accused of both murder and being a felon in possession of a handgun the night of the shooting.


Court records show both men have pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges in connection with the Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez slaying.


Four of the men charged in the murder were identified as members of the Westside Verdugo gang, police said, while Manzano is from an unidentified Redlands gang. Police said the gangs are obedient or submissive to the Mexican Mafia’s orders from prison.


The task force’s effort, “Operation Green Hand,” also resulted in 86 other arrests on suspicion of various weapons, conspiracy, auto theft and narcotics charges. Those arrests were announced last year.


“The purpose of this task force was to target gang members in prison whom were attempting to influence the local street gangs of San Bernardino in addition to identify those who were involved in the murder of Carmen Rodriguez,” the police statement said.


Agencies involved in the task force include the San Bernardino Police Department’s Homicide Unit, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, Fontana police, the FBI; the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the California Highway Patrol and the state Department of Justice.

Five men police call gang members have been charged in the San Bernardino shooting death of a wife of a Mexican Mafia member, authorities said on Wednesday, adding that the killing was orchestrated behind bars and one of the accused has since been slain.


The Jan. 18, 2017 death of Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez, 41, of North Hills was planned by the five defendants — three of whom were in the state prison system while the plot came together — said authorities, who have not disclosed a possible motive for the killing. While the charges don’t name the alleged shooter or shooters, one defendant is charged with being a felon in possession of a handgun the night of the shooting.


The victim was previously identified by authorities as Carmen Gutierrez Rodriguez.


The complaint filed in the case said the slaying was “for the benefit, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang,” and was done to further criminal conduct by gang members. It also accuses the defendants of street terrorism.

Acosta, 52, has negotiated contracts with more than 20 law enforcement agencies across three counties.


But he can’t get one in San Bernardino.


“I’ve never had such a problem obtaining a franchise or tow service agreement with a city,” Acosta said Tuesday, July 17, from his East Victoria Avenue tow yard.


For 18 years, Pepe’s Towing Service has been unable to secure a contract with San Bernardino, despite the Police Department using the company for hauls that require a big rig, Acosta said. He’s taking the issue up with the City Council at its meeting Wednesday, July 18.


The California Highway Patrol and the San Bernardino County Auto Theft Task Force (SANCATT) are among the agencies utilizing Acosta’s services.


“We work well together,” CHP Lt. Tony Pena said Tuesday. “We’ve experienced nothing but great stuff with Pepe’s. They’re always there to help.”


In 2008, San Bernardino leaders created a tow services franchise agreement that provided for one tow company per 35,000 residents. Three years later, the city and its six carriers negotiated an agreement that required future franchisees have 65,000 square feet of outside storage space.


Acosta asserts the city grandfathered its carriers into the agreement and that none of the businesses have ever had that sort of room. Police officials could not confirm whether the carriers had the requisite outdoor space.


“I think (the minimum lot size) was a way to keep people out of contracts,” Acosta said.


City officials declined to comment Tuesday.


Two years ago, the tow services agreement was extended through 2021.


According to a 2017 memo from police Capt. Paul Williams to Chief Jarrod Burguan, the Traffic Unit inspected all six tow carriers that March and deemed them in compliance with the minimum requirements of the agreement, though the memo does not specify those requirements.


A staff report prepared for the council meeting Wednesday says carriers have been informed of non-compliant items and provided a time frame to address them. While the time frame to make improvements still is active, Acosta doesn’t expect the carriers to bring their yards into compliance.


“It’s not cost effective to come up to code,” he said.

Earlier this year, the city solicited bids for a seventh tow carrier to keep up with the increase in population.


Pepe’s was one of two companies to apply, but was denied, notably, due to its outdoor storage space, which, at 40,000 square feet, can fit about 200 cars of all sizes, Acosta said.


An appeal of the city’s denial will be heard at Wednesday’s council meeting.

Acosta, who has made improvements at the city’s behest, contends the space requirement is excessive given the volume of cars towed in San Bernardino.


The Police Department tows about 3,500 cars a year, he said, which, divided by six towers, is nearly 600 cars a year or 50 cars a month per franchisee. And not all cars stay in a yard for the same amount of time, Acosta said, adding later that 65,000 square feet of outdoor storage space accommodates about 500 cars.


The six current tow carriers must agree to remove the storage space requirement, the staff report says.


In addition to San Bernardino and Colton, Pepe’s has yards in Fontana, Moreno Valley, Ontario and Rialto.


The City Council meets at 5 p.m. Wednesday, July 18, at the Council Chambers, 201 N. E St.

SAN BERNARDINO – Nearly three decades ago, Manny Acosta expanded his father’s Los Angeles towing business into the Inland Empire, opening a location in Colton with one truck.


Now, Pepe’s Towing Service has 11 Southern California locations and 74 trucks.

The White House has asked San Bernardino city leaders to support Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the United States Supreme Court, a “puzzling” request according to one political expert.


Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College, struggled to find a reason behind the gesture, pointing out that Democratic U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris won’t support Kavanaugh no matter what San Bernardino leaders say.


“If I were working in the Trump White House,” Pitney added, “I would be focusing on the small number of senators who might tip either way. I’d be, for example, focusing on local officials in Maine or Alaska.


“It’s hard to see why they came for communities in California.”


The San Bernardino City Council is scheduled to discuss the matter Wednesday, July 18.


President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh earlier this month after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement in June. The retirement is effective July 31.

Earlier this week, at least one San Bernardino councilmember also wondered why the White House had reached out to the nonpartisan body on a partisan issue.


“I’m interested to see what weight our decision is going to make for that appointment,” said Councilwoman Virginia Marquez, a Democrat. “We’re just council members. We’re at the local level. Although Supreme Court nominees normally do have a huge impact on our daily lives, I wonder why we were selected.”


Judd Deere, White House director of state communications, confirmed the request and said the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs “regularly reaches out to state, mayoral and other local offices to keep them apprised of actions taken by the administration.


“This was part of a broad effort to inform local offices of the President’s decision and provide them an outlet to voice their support should they so choose,” he added.


Deere could not confirm whether the White House had reached out to any other Southern California city.


Last year, San Bernardino city leaders sent a letter to Trump asking for help with crime, drug abuse and other pressing issues in the city. Drafted by Mayor Carey Davis, the letter was signed by all seven councilmembers, as well as the city attorney, police chief and then-city manager.


Community outrage followed, and about two weeks after sending the letter, the City Council instituted a new policy requiring council-endorsed notes be open to a public discussion and public vote.

Neither Marquez nor Councilman Henry Nickel recalled the White House soliciting support for President Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch.


Still, Nickel was pleased with the White House’s request.


“It’s an indication that the current administration understands they need to reach out and have a good working relationship with local governments around the country,” said Nickel, who said he met Kavanaugh when studying law.


“Also,” he added, “that they understand what effect these appointments have when it comes to local control and ensuring we have the ability to do what we need to at the local level in partnership with our federal counterparts.”


Kavanaugh, 53, is a graduate of Yale Law School, a former clerk to the retiring Kennedy, a White House aide for President George W. Bush, and a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit since 2006.


His nomination has been praised by Republicans and criticized by Democrats.


The judge’s appointment would shift the country’s highest court further to the right and likely have lasting implications on abortion, gun rights and the future of Obamacare, Democrats have said. Kavanaugh also has favored limits on investigating the president.


Nickel, a Republican candidate for the 40th Assembly District, called the judge an excellent pick for the Supreme Court.


The City Council will meet at 5 p.m. Wednesday, July 18, at the Council Chambers, 201 N. E St., San Bernardino.

PUBLISHED: July 16, 2018 at 7:33 pm | UPDATED: July 16, 2018 at 9:19 pm

Police arrested a woman Monday suspected of last week’s hit-and-run collision in San Bernardino that killed a pregnant pedestrian as she crossed the street in a marked crosswalk.


Police obtained an arrest warrant for Mercedes Vanesa Guevara as part of their comprehensive investigation for the driver of the dark-colored sedan that slammed into 39-year-old Maribel Gonzalez while she crossed Highland Avenue — north to south — at Medical Central Drive about 11:30 p.m. July 11, according to a San Bernardino police news release.


Guevara, 31, was located and arrested about 12:45 p.m. Monday in Corona, according to online jail records. She was booked into Central Detention Center in San Bernardino on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter, the news release stated. She is being held in lieu of $200,000 bail.


Guevara is scheduled to make her initial court appearance Wednesday in San Bernardino Superior Court, according to jail records.


Police say Guevara drove through a red light at the intersection at a high rate of speed and struck Gonzalez while she was in the crosswalk. Guevara didn’t stop and help the victim, according to the police news release.


The suspect vehicle continued west on Highland Avenue, became disabled and stopped a short distance away. Police say Guevara got out of her car, was picked up a short time later by another vehicle and fled the area, the news release states.


Gonzalez and her unborn child were pronounced dead at the scene.


Police are still looking for the accomplice who picked up Guevara. Anyone with information about the investigation can call San Bernardino Police Department at 909-384-5742.

Police arrested a woman Monday suspected of last week’s hit-and-run collision in San Bernardino that killed a pregnant pedestrian as she crossed the street in a marked crosswalk.


Police obtained an arrest warrant for Mercedes Vanesa Guevara as part of their comprehensive investigation for the driver of the dark-colored sedan that slammed into 39-year-old Maribel Gonzalez while she crossed Highland Avenue — north to south — at Medical Central Drive about 11:30 p.m. July 11, according to a San Bernardino police news release.


Guevara, 31, was located and arrested about 12:45 p.m. Monday in Corona, according to online jail records. She was booked into Central Detention Center in San Bernardino on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter, the news release stated. She is being held in lieu of $200,000 bail.


Guevara is scheduled to make her initial court appearance Wednesday in San Bernardino Superior Court, according to jail records.


Police say Guevara drove through a red light at the intersection at a high rate of speed and struck Gonzalez while she was in the crosswalk. Guevara didn’t stop and help the victim, according to the police news release.


The suspect vehicle continued west on Highland Avenue, became disabled and stopped a short distance away. Police say Guevara got out of her car, was picked up a short time later by another vehicle and fled the area, the news release states.


Gonzalez and her unborn child were pronounced dead at the scene.


Police are still looking for the accomplice who picked up Guevara. Anyone with information about the investigation can call San Bernardino Police Department at 909-384-5742.

A 49-year-old Ontario resident was arrested Wednesday, July 18, on suspicion of child molestation.


Ernesto Santos is believed to have molested a family member numerous times, an Ontario police news release said. He was arrested in the 1000 block of North Mountain Avenue on suspicion of lewd and lascivious acts with a child younger than 14. He is being held at West Valley Detention Center in lieu of $500,000 bail.


Investigators believe Santos may have sexually assaulted other children, the release said. They ask anyone with information to call Detective Dave Newland at 909-408-1898 or 909-986-6711, or report tips anonymously to We-Tip at 800-782-7463 or to its website at wetip.com.

A 49-year-old Ontario resident was arrested Wednesday, July 18, on suspicion of child molestation.


Ernesto Santos is believed to have molested a family member numerous times, an Ontario police news release said. He was arrested in the 1000 block of North Mountain Avenue on suspicion of lewd and lascivious acts with a child younger than 14. He is being held at West Valley Detention Center in lieu of $500,000 bail.


Investigators believe Santos may have sexually assaulted other children, the release said. They ask anyone with information to call Detective Dave Newland at 909-408-1898 or 909-986-6711, or report tips anonymously to We-Tip at 800-782-7463 or to its website at wetip.com.

The 16-year-old gunshot victim who had been dropped behind a 7-Eleven in Yucaipa on Saturday by motorists who then fled had earlier attempted to burglarize the home of a 69-year-old man who owns a gun, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said.


The teenage boy, who is a Desert Hot Springs resident, and two other men had tried to break in to a home in the 33000 block of Wallace Way in Yucaipa, a news release said. The homeowner confronted the three as they tried to force their way through a backyard window. As they fled, he fired one shot, striking the teen.


The driver of the vehicle was seen placing the teen on the ground behind the 7-Eleven near Yucaipa Boulevard and 14th Street just before 6:15 p.m. and then driving off. The homeowner reported the burglary 30 minutes later but not the shooting, the release said.

Tuesday, detectives found evidence at the home that the 69-year-old had fired his gun. They also found the Ford Mustang GT driven by the burglars, the release said. Detectives are trying to find the two men and a woman who were in the car and left the 16-year-old behind.


No one has been arrested and the names of those involved have not been publicly released. The District Attorney’s Office will determine whether to bring charges.


Deputies ask anyone with information about the incident to call Deputy Coillot at the Yucaipa Station, 909-918-2305. Anonymous calls can be made to the We-Tip Hotline at 800-782-7463 or the website at wetip.com.

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 6:00 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 7:33 pm

The 16-year-old gunshot victim who had been dropped behind a 7-Eleven in Yucaipa on Saturday by motorists who then fled had earlier attempted to burglarize the home of a 69-year-old man who owns a gun, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said.


The teenage boy, who is a Desert Hot Springs resident, and two other men had tried to break in to a home in the 33000 block of Wallace Way in Yucaipa, a news release said. The homeowner confronted the three as they tried to force their way through a backyard window. As they fled, he fired one shot, striking the teen.


The driver of the vehicle was seen placing the teen on the ground behind the 7-Eleven near Yucaipa Boulevard and 14th Street just before 6:15 p.m. and then driving off. The homeowner reported the burglary 30 minutes later but not the shooting, the release said.

Tuesday, detectives found evidence at the home that the 69-year-old had fired his gun. They also found the Ford Mustang GT driven by the burglars, the release said. Detectives are trying to find the two men and a woman who were in the car and left the 16-year-old behind.


No one has been arrested and the names of those involved have not been publicly released. The District Attorney’s Office will determine whether to bring charges.


Deputies ask anyone with information about the incident to call Deputy Coillot at the Yucaipa Station, 909-918-2305. Anonymous calls can be made to the We-Tip Hotline at 800-782-7463 or the website at wetip.com.

Four years after its attendance numbers hit an all-time low, San Bernardino County Museum in 2016-17 continues to make gains in visitors, officials reported earlier this month.


Attendance at the main museum in Redlands slid to 38,000 in 2014 – down from 109,000 in 2001. In the past fiscal year, which ended June 30, attendance at the main museum rose to 63,351, a 66 percent increase from 2014.


Though attendance has yet to return to 2001 levels, museum and county officials are celebrating the turnaround.


“We’re totally excited that more people are coming because ultimately that’s what we want to do,” said museum director Melissa Russo. “We really want to connect residents to the culture and history and environment of the county.”


In 2014, a consulting firm recommended 29 changes at the museum, following revelations about problems in leadership.


Since then, the museum brought on Russo, successfully earned a 10-year accreditation, and has been steadily growing attendance numbers. The museum, based in Redlands with sites in Rancho Cucamonga, Colton, Yucaipa and more, saw a 14 percent increase in visitors to all sites in 2016-17.


At the Victor Valley Museum branch in Apple Valley alone, attendance grew 48 percent in the past year, from 5,523 to 8,222.


Russo said the museum’s success stems from increasing the rate of new exhibits and programs to keep visitors coming back. An increase in school field trips – up to 17,000 from about 13,500 students in the past year at the main museum alone – also helped.


Meanwhile, museum curators are broadening exhibits.


The “Minerals Rock! Unearthing the Human Element” exhibit, which opened July 5 in Redlands, isn’t just about geology, it includes biology and chemistry, and discusses mining in the area, cultural history, the different colors of minerals and how different cultures used them for dying textiles or making jewelry.


“We’re trying to make all of our exhibits very multi-disciplinary so that it tells a fuller story,” Russo said. “So a rock is not just a rock, it’s connected to everything else; it’s part of a story, it’s part of our history, it’s part of the industry of this area.”


“Mechanized Magic: 40 Years of Garner Holt Productions in San Bernardino County,” which runs through Nov. 25 in Redlands, is another crowd-pleaser, she said.


The show follows the rise of the animatronics giant, which was founded in 1977 in Holt’s parents’ San Bernardino garage, offering a look into science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics fields with hands-on opportunities.

In Apple Valley, attendance gains are thanks at least in part to the CuriousCITY exhibit for children under 5, which opened in August, Russo said.


The early-learning interactive play space encourages kids to use their imagination with a city theme, offering post office and store structures, and costumes.


Next up, the museum plans a citrus exhibit tying in agriculture and history. It’s set to open in May, with a tongue-in-cheek working title of “Pulp Culture.”

“We are seeing impressive measureable results in attracting visitors to our county museums,” Board of Supervisors Chairman Robert Lovingood said in a news release from the museum. “I think changes we’ve made in recent years are paying off, and I’m optimistic the trend will continue.”


Attendance, Russo said, is just one data point, “but I think it’s one of the most important ones that illustrates whether or not we’re of interest to the community. That’s our mission. If people aren’t coming, we might as well close our doors.”


The museum aims to exceed 100,000 visitors at the main site in Redlands by 2022.

Four years after its attendance numbers hit an all-time low, San Bernardino County Museum in 2016-17 continues to make gains in visitors, officials reported earlier this month.


Attendance at the main museum in Redlands slid to 38,000 in 2014 – down from 109,000 in 2001. In the past fiscal year, which ended June 30, attendance at the main museum rose to 63,351, a 66 percent increase from 2014.


Though attendance has yet to return to 2001 levels, museum and county officials are celebrating the turnaround.


“We’re totally excited that more people are coming because ultimately that’s what we want to do,” said museum director Melissa Russo. “We really want to connect residents to the culture and history and environment of the county.”


In 2014, a consulting firm recommended 29 changes at the museum, following revelations about problems in leadership.


Since then, the museum brought on Russo, successfully earned a 10-year accreditation, and has been steadily growing attendance numbers. The museum, based in Redlands with sites in Rancho Cucamonga, Colton, Yucaipa and more, saw a 14 percent increase in visitors to all sites in 2016-17.


At the Victor Valley Museum branch in Apple Valley alone, attendance grew 48 percent in the past year, from 5,523 to 8,222.


Russo said the museum’s success stems from increasing the rate of new exhibits and programs to keep visitors coming back. An increase in school field trips – up to 17,000 from about 13,500 students in the past year at the main museum alone – also helped.


Meanwhile, museum curators are broadening exhibits.


The “Minerals Rock! Unearthing the Human Element” exhibit, which opened July 5 in Redlands, isn’t just about geology, it includes biology and chemistry, and discusses mining in the area, cultural history, the different colors of minerals and how different cultures used them for dying textiles or making jewelry.


“We’re trying to make all of our exhibits very multi-disciplinary so that it tells a fuller story,” Russo said. “So a rock is not just a rock, it’s connected to everything else; it’s part of a story, it’s part of our history, it’s part of the industry of this area.”


“Mechanized Magic: 40 Years of Garner Holt Productions in San Bernardino County,” which runs through Nov. 25 in Redlands, is another crowd-pleaser, she said.


The show follows the rise of the animatronics giant, which was founded in 1977 in Holt’s parents’ San Bernardino garage, offering a look into science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics fields with hands-on opportunities.

In Apple Valley, attendance gains are thanks at least in part to the CuriousCITY exhibit for children under 5, which opened in August, Russo said.


The early-learning interactive play space encourages kids to use their imagination with a city theme, offering post office and store structures, and costumes.


Next up, the museum plans a citrus exhibit tying in agriculture and history. It’s set to open in May, with a tongue-in-cheek working title of “Pulp Culture.”

“We are seeing impressive measureable results in attracting visitors to our county museums,” Board of Supervisors Chairman Robert Lovingood said in a news release from the museum. “I think changes we’ve made in recent years are paying off, and I’m optimistic the trend will continue.”


Attendance, Russo said, is just one data point, “but I think it’s one of the most important ones that illustrates whether or not we’re of interest to the community. That’s our mission. If people aren’t coming, we might as well close our doors.”


The museum aims to exceed 100,000 visitors at the main site in Redlands by 2022.

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 4:32 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 9:44 pm

A Southern California car wash mogul cited for cheating more than 800 workers and destroying evidence will pay $4.2 million in back wages and penalties after a two-year court battle with federal authorities.


Vahid David Delrahim, of Los Angeles, failed to pay his workers minimum wage or overtime at a dozen car washes in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.


A consent decree approved this week by U.S. District Court Judge Fernando Olguin orders Delrahim to pay $1.9 million in back wages and another $1.9 million in damages to the workers. In addition, he is fined $400,000 in civil penalties.


“This landmark case sends a powerful message that the Department of Labor will use strong law enforcement and litigation tools to protect employees and level the playing field for law-abiding employers,” said Juan Coria, the wage and hour division’s acting regional commissioner.


According to the judgment, Delrahim ordered employees, many of them Spanish-speakers unfamiliar with U.S. labor laws, to work off the clock at the beginning of each shift and to clock out, but to remain at the car washes, when business was slow. The result: numerous hours without pay.


The court-ordered back wages cover a period from 2013 to the present. More workers and more money may be added to the case, according to the 42-page decree, as “the identity of all employees who worked [at the 12 car washes] is presently unknown.”


Delrahim is required to furnish more names, addresses and workplace records—originally requested by prosecutors in 2016—within 30 days.


As a result of the judgment, some employees will receive more than $10,000 in back wages.


Delrahim, a prominent member of Southern California’s Iranian diaspora and a cousin of President Donald Trump’s anti-trust chief, Makan Delrahim, owns more than 100 car washes and gas stations through Agoura Hills-based companies: Brea Car Wash & Detail Center (also known as Southwest Fuel Management), Goldenwest Solutions Group, and California Payroll Group.

“We made a business decision to end the civil litigation,” his public relations firm said in a statement. “Our decision did not admit any wrongdoing on our part, but will enable the leaders and employees of our business to focus their time and effort on business instead of a costly civil trial.”


State and federal officials bring hundreds of wage theft claims each year against California car washes, garment contractors, caregiver facilities, restaurants and construction firms—the industries with the highest number of violations.


The Delrahim case is unusual in that few wage and hour disputes end up in court. But Delrahim hired one of the nation’s most aggressive employer law firms, Littler Mendelson, leading to two years of court battles and more than 200,000 pages in filings, documents, depositions and testimony.


Delrahim’s Los Angeles-based lawyer, Rebecca Aragon, specialized in helping “companies employing Spanish-speaking work forces” with “union avoidance” and other strategies, according to her firm biography.


The case exploded into a fight over legal ethics. Shortly after the investigation began, Delrahim and Littler were notified of the duty to preserve potential evidence. Nonetheless, text messages, email accounts and videos recording workers’ comings and goings, which prosecutors deemed likely to prove the government’s case, were destroyed.


The court sanctioned Delrahim and Littler five times for withholding documents and for coercive tactics towards employee witnesses. They were ordered to reimburse the government $23,850 in legal fees.


“The court’s decisions make clear that our laws protect workers and neither an employer nor their attorneys may interfere with their rights,” said Regional Solicitor Janet Herold.


The settlement attested to the lack of trust. It orders Delrahim not to encourage his managers “to ensure that labor costs are kept at or below a fixed percentage of the car wash’s sales.” And it appoints an “independent monitor” who can enter his car washes for a year without prior notice to inspect all payroll records and time cards.

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 4:32 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 9:44 pm

A Southern California car wash mogul cited for cheating more than 800 workers and destroying evidence will pay $4.2 million in back wages and penalties after a two-year court battle with federal authorities.


Vahid David Delrahim, of Los Angeles, failed to pay his workers minimum wage or overtime at a dozen car washes in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.


A consent decree approved this week by U.S. District Court Judge Fernando Olguin orders Delrahim to pay $1.9 million in back wages and another $1.9 million in damages to the workers. In addition, he is fined $400,000 in civil penalties.


“This landmark case sends a powerful message that the Department of Labor will use strong law enforcement and litigation tools to protect employees and level the playing field for law-abiding employers,” said Juan Coria, the wage and hour division’s acting regional commissioner.


According to the judgment, Delrahim ordered employees, many of them Spanish-speakers unfamiliar with U.S. labor laws, to work off the clock at the beginning of each shift and to clock out, but to remain at the car washes, when business was slow. The result: numerous hours without pay.

Delrahim is required to furnish more names, addresses and workplace records—originally requested by prosecutors in 2016—within 30 days.


As a result of the judgment, some employees will receive more than $10,000 in back wages.


Delrahim, a prominent member of Southern California’s Iranian diaspora and a cousin of President Donald Trump’s anti-trust chief, Makan Delrahim, owns more than 100 car washes and gas stations through Agoura Hills-based companies: Brea Car Wash & Detail Center (also known as Southwest Fuel Management), Goldenwest Solutions Group, and California Payroll Group.

“We made a business decision to end the civil litigation,” his public relations firm said in a statement. “Our decision did not admit any wrongdoing on our part, but will enable the leaders and employees of our business to focus their time and effort on business instead of a costly civil trial.”


State and federal officials bring hundreds of wage theft claims each year against California car washes, garment contractors, caregiver facilities, restaurants and construction firms—the industries with the highest number of violations.


The Delrahim case is unusual in that few wage and hour disputes end up in court. But Delrahim hired one of the nation’s most aggressive employer law firms, Littler Mendelson, leading to two years of court battles and more than 200,000 pages in filings, documents, depositions and testimony.

A 53-year-old man pleaded not guilty Friday to raping and kidnapping his ex-girlfriend who he drove from Yorba Linda to Hesperia.


Monsuru Wole Sho is charged with rape, kidnapping, criminal threats, domestic violence, all felonies, and a misdemeanor count of aggravated trespass.


Sho’s 50-year-old ex-girlfriend woke up about 2 a.m., June 20, with the defendant in her bedroom, according to a legal motion to increase Sho’s bail.


An argument escalated into a physical altercation in which he “crushed” her head with his knees as he took her clothes off, according to the motion. The defendant then allegedly sexually assaulted her with his fingers before raping her, investigators alleged in the motion.


The victim ran out of her home after Sho fell asleep and shouted for help, but he chased after her and then dragged her by the hair into his car, investigators alleged in the motion. He drove her to a cousin’s home in Hesperia, and while she was in the backseat he allegedly slapped her and pulled her hair so hard that she got into the front seat, where he punched her in the arm while driving, the motion alleged.


When they stopped at a gas station she again tried to get away and he dragged her back into the car, investigators alleged.

When they arrived in Hesperia she convinced her ex-boyfriend and his cousin to drive her back home, investigators alleged in the motion. A neighbor saw them pulling up and confronted the cousin, prompting the two to quickly leave, investigators said.


Later, in a covert call the victim made to Sho with investigators eavesdropping, the defendant “apologized,” and indicated he was suicidal and wanted to flee back to his native Nigeria, investigators alleged.


Sho was being held in lieu of $5 million bail, according to sheriff’s records.


Sho was ordered to return to court July 25 for a pretrial hearing.

PUBLISHED: July 12, 2018 at 1:30 pm | UPDATED: July 12, 2018 at 6:44 pm

Dozens of cars were stranded for hours in floodwaters and mud Thursday afternoon, prompting authorities to shut down Highway 38 near Valley of the Falls Drive in the Forest Falls and Highway 18 on the backside of Big Bear in Lucerne Valley, California Highway Patrol officials said.


Flood waters had subsided as of 2:30 p.m., and Caltrans crews worked to clear the roadway, according to CHP and San Bernardino County fire officials. By 4:45 p.m., the closed section of Highway 18 was reopened, according to the CHP.


The most serious flooding stranded a reported 32 vehicles along Highway 18 between Big Bear and Lucerne Valley starting just after 12:30 p.m., according to CHP reports. The area that was most affected was between the Mitsubishi concrete facility and Johnson Creek, Officer Chris Carter, a CHP spokesman, said Thursday afternoon.


“There’s about a 2-and-a-half mile stretch of highway that’s impassable,” Carter said. One of the main sections of mud was about 5 feet deep by 80 feet wide, according to Carter.

A white Honda Ridgeline was reported stuck in the mud about 12:29 p.m., according to Terri Kasinga, a Caltrans spokeswoman. Crews will be working to clear the mud and rock for the next few hours, she said at the time.


The driver, James Bondurant, said he’d been driving up Highway 18 when he noticed flooding.


“I’m driving up the hill trying to get past all these floods and it’s literally coming up to my car and (the highway) was just completely wiped out, there was nowhere to go,” he said. “So I turned around, tried to go back and … in a manner of minutes we were trapped in this little area — couldn’t get out.”


Bondurant said he was grateful Caltrans responded so quickly. About three hours after getting stuck, he said he hoped to be out soon.

The rushing water at Oak and Valley of the Falls drives near Highway 38 caught an 87-year-old woman in its flow until she was rescued by a San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputy with help from a water truck, the department’s Yucaipa station said on Twitter.


Authorities were “calling to close the road for a 1- to 2-foot wall of water and mud coming down” in Forest Falls along Highway 38, said CHP Officer Marcelo Llerena Thursday afternoon.

There were no reports of injuries in Forest Falls, but Llerena did confirm at least one vehicle was reported stuck in the mud in the Forest Falls mudslide. It was unclear if that was the same vehicle Yucaipa sheriff’s deputies assisted.


Dispatchers began to receive calls of the mudslide just after noon, CHP incident logs indicated.


“We did have some debris flow on (Highway) 38 between Valley of the Falls and Sugar Pine,” Kasinga said. The highway was reopened Thursday evening.

PUBLISHED: July 12, 2018 at 1:30 pm | UPDATED: July 12, 2018 at 6:44 pm

Dozens of cars were stranded for hours in floodwaters and mud Thursday afternoon, prompting authorities to shut down Highway 38 near Valley of the Falls Drive in the Forest Falls and Highway 18 on the backside of Big Bear in Lucerne Valley, California Highway Patrol officials said.


Flood waters had subsided as of 2:30 p.m., and Caltrans crews worked to clear the roadway, according to CHP and San Bernardino County fire officials. By 4:45 p.m., the closed section of Highway 18 was reopened, according to the CHP.


The most serious flooding stranded a reported 32 vehicles along Highway 18 between Big Bear and Lucerne Valley starting just after 12:30 p.m., according to CHP reports. The area that was most affected was between the Mitsubishi concrete facility and Johnson Creek, Officer Chris Carter, a CHP spokesman, said Thursday afternoon.


“There’s about a 2-and-a-half mile stretch of highway that’s impassable,” Carter said. One of the main sections of mud was about 5 feet deep by 80 feet wide, according to Carter.

By Patrick Brien | |

PUBLISHED: July 12, 2018 at 1:00 pm | UPDATED: July 12, 2018 at 1:01 pm

Karla J. Franko grew up loving to make people laugh. She was always the class clown.


The Apple Valley resident can’t remember a time when she wasn’t acting out characters.


“I was always yearning to tell stories and was always a bit over the top and dramatic,” she said. “My friends in junior high used to pretend they had laryngitis and try to get me to give their speeches for them in speech class.”

Born and raised in Indiana, Franko started taking dance lessons at 3. She said her mother “squirreled away grocery money” to put her and her two sisters into an Indianapolis dance studio. Franko’s mother wanted to be an opera singer. Her father sang in the company choir at General Motors, where he worked.


“The apple didn’t fall far from the tree,” Franko said.

After a year and a half at Manchester College, Franko left, wanting to do theater rather than learn about it. She tried New York, but found the weather too cold for her liking, so she made her way to North Hollywood to pursue a career in television and film.


It would be the stage that would end up winning Franko’s heart, however.


Franko and her husband, a fourth-grade teacher, decided to buy a house in the High Desert because of its affordability. That means that Franko has to commute to auditions, rehearsals and performances as far away as Thousand Oaks and San Diego.


“If you want to work in Los Angeles regional theater, you have to commute,” Franko said.


Her current production only takes her as far as Fontana’s Center Stage Theatre, where she is playing Miss Hannigan in “Annie” for the first Summer Family Series collaboration between Center Stage and Claremont’s Inland Valley Repertory Theatre.


It is Franko’s second time playing Hannigan. She appeared in the role last summer for the Chance Theatre and Tustin Area Council for Fine Arts.


“I love Miss Hannigan,” she said. “She is the villainess you love to hate. I love how she brings out the human side of desperation with humor and sarcasm.”


Another of Franko’s favorite roles has been Martha Watson in Irving Berlin’s “White Christmas,” which she has done the past several years at San Diego Musical Theatre.


“She gets a show-stopping song, all the laughs and best lines, and she’s the comic relief in a feel-good show about traditions and the holiday spirit,” she said. “How can I resist?”


A lasting success of Franko’s that goes beyond her work on the stage has been the creation of Standing Room Only Productions.

“Where we live in the High Desert there was not anything of its kind,” she said. “My daughter and several of her friends were longing to have theater training, but there was not much to offer, so I decided to hang out a shingle and try to motivate kids to ignite their creative talents and help fan the flame of their performing potential.”


Beginning in 2003 as a children’s performing arts camp, Standing Room Only became a non-profit young performer’s training company in 2005.


“Now, 13 years later, we have kids performing on cruise ships, in Disneyland main stage shows around the world, working on Broadway, in national tours, doing Vegas shows, and living in other high-profile theater cities around the country and excelling at their craft,” Franko said.


Among those success stories is Franko’s daughter Cheslea, who is currently in her 13th city on the national tour of “Wicked” as the standby for Elphaba.

PUBLISHED: July 12, 2018 at 1:00 pm | UPDATED: July 12, 2018 at 1:01 pm

Karla J. Franko grew up loving to make people laugh. She was always the class clown.


The Apple Valley resident can’t remember a time when she wasn’t acting out characters.


“I was always yearning to tell stories and was always a bit over the top and dramatic,” she said. “My friends in junior high used to pretend they had laryngitis and try to get me to give their speeches for them in speech class.”

Born and raised in Indiana, Franko started taking dance lessons at 3. She said her mother “squirreled away grocery money” to put her and her two sisters into an Indianapolis dance studio. Franko’s mother wanted to be an opera singer. Her father sang in the company choir at General Motors, where he worked.


“The apple didn’t fall far from the tree,” Franko said.

After a year and a half at Manchester College, Franko left, wanting to do theater rather than learn about it. She tried New York, but found the weather too cold for her liking, so she made her way to North Hollywood to pursue a career in television and film.


It would be the stage that would end up winning Franko’s heart, however.


Franko and her husband, a fourth-grade teacher, decided to buy a house in the High Desert because of its affordability. That means that Franko has to commute to auditions, rehearsals and performances as far away as Thousand Oaks and San Diego.


“If you want to work in Los Angeles regional theater, you have to commute,” Franko said.


Her current production only takes her as far as Fontana’s Center Stage Theatre, where she is playing Miss Hannigan in “Annie” for the first Summer Family Series collaboration between Center Stage and Claremont’s Inland Valley Repertory Theatre.


It is Franko’s second time playing Hannigan. She appeared in the role last summer for the Chance Theatre and Tustin Area Council for Fine Arts.


“I love Miss Hannigan,” she said. “She is the villainess you love to hate. I love how she brings out the human side of desperation with humor and sarcasm.”


Another of Franko’s favorite roles has been Martha Watson in Irving Berlin’s “White Christmas,” which she has done the past several years at San Diego Musical Theatre.


“She gets a show-stopping song, all the laughs and best lines, and she’s the comic relief in a feel-good show about traditions and the holiday spirit,” she said. “How can I resist?”


A lasting success of Franko’s that goes beyond her work on the stage has been the creation of Standing Room Only Productions.

“Where we live in the High Desert there was not anything of its kind,” she said. “My daughter and several of her friends were longing to have theater training, but there was not much to offer, so I decided to hang out a shingle and try to motivate kids to ignite their creative talents and help fan the flame of their performing potential.”


Beginning in 2003 as a children’s performing arts camp, Standing Room Only became a non-profit young performer’s training company in 2005.


“Now, 13 years later, we have kids performing on cruise ships, in Disneyland main stage shows around the world, working on Broadway, in national tours, doing Vegas shows, and living in other high-profile theater cities around the country and excelling at their craft,” Franko said.


Among those success stories is Franko’s daughter Cheslea, who is currently in her 13th city on the national tour of “Wicked” as the standby for Elphaba.

By Brooke Staggs | bstaggs@scng.com and Shane Newell | snewell@scng.com | Orange County Register

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 2:56 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 3:35 pm

In some regions of California, former vineyards are being converted to cannabis farms, wine conferences are having sessions about marijuana, and an up-and-coming job is cannabis sommelier.


While the wine and marijuana industries are similar in some ways, blending those worlds isn’t always easy. Winegrowers and cannabis cultivators increasingly square off over customers, land and workers. And lingering stigmas have kept some of the state’s wine-growing regions from being open to the newly legalized marijuana market.


Now it seems Temecula Valley Wine Country is on track to shut out the cannabis industry. Opposition from local winegrowers and government officials is making it unlikely that marijuana businesses will be allowed to operate in one of the most important agricultural and tourism regions in Riverside County.

“My fear is that you would see vineyards pushed out and there would be outdoor cultivation with chain-linked, barbed-wire fences,” said Danny Martin, board president for the Temecula Valley Winegrowers Association.


“We want to be the Temecula Valley Wine Country. We don’t want to become the Temecula Valley Weed Country.”


The message is clear, according to Micah Anderson, president of the cannabis cultivation trade group Southern California Responsible Growers Council.


“Wine is socially acceptable here,” Anderson said. “Cannabis isn’t.”


Ordinance carves out Temecula Valley


Though passage of Proposition 64 in 2016 made it legal in California for adults to consume cannabis, the law also gives cities and counties the authority to regulate most other marijuana activities within their borders.


All marijuana businesses are currently banned in unincorporated Riverside County. However, county leaders are considering an ordinance that would be among the most permissive in California, allowing businesses to grow, manufacture, test, distribute and sell marijuana products in most of the county’s unincorporated areas.


But, as proposed, the Riverside County ordinance would block marijuana businesses from two key areas — residential areas and the Temecula Valley Wine Country. The popular wine-tasting destination has a few dozen wineries spread over more than 17,000 acres of county-controlled land, just east of Temecula’s city limits.


Riverside County Planning Department staff said via email that cannabis cultivation is “not compatible” with the long-term planning for that area, which they said provides a “significant tourist attraction” and “economic benefit” to the region.


Supervisor Chuck Washington — whose district includes Temecula Valley and who once invested in an area winery — also opposes cannabis cultivation in the area because he doesn’t believe it would “further the goals” of the region, according to his chief of staff, Jeff Comerchero.


In a June 20 letter, Martin told Washington that the Temecula Valley Winegrowers Association board supported a ban on all commercial cannabis activities in wine country and asked the Board of Supervisors to “continue to deny all inconsistent land uses within this special agricultural area in our county.”


County staff said the first listed goal for the wine region is to “encourage agricultural cultivation.” Cannabis cultivation is an agricultural activity, Anderson said, with growers licensed by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. And cannabis, he added, should be treated as an agricultural product by local regulators.


But Martin insists that adding cannabis-related businesses in Temecula Valley Wine Country would be inconsistent with the existing zoning plan for the area.


Lessons learned


The wine and cannabis industries have coexisted for decades in places such as Mendocino and Sonoma counties, pointed out Josh Drayton, spokesman for the California Cannabis Industry Association.


But now that the state is licensing cannabis businesses for the first time, he said marijuana farmers can come out of the shadows to fight for the same rights and business opportunities wine growers have worked to secure.


“I think the cannabis industry has learned a lot from the wine industry,” Drayton said. “A lot of the challenges they have faced, and found solutions for, are guiding forces for our industry.”


That includes trying to brand cannabis products with appellations of origin. Meaning only marijuana grown in Humboldt County can have that label, just like only wines grown in Napa Valley can boast that origin.

Mom-and-pop wineries have also found creative ways to compete with bigger, corporate vineyards, Drayton said — a struggle that’s just starting for smaller and medium-sized marijuana growers. Transferable strategies might include tax incentives for small operators, boutique tours, paired dinners directed by sommeliers and direct-to-consumer sales that give owners a chance to sell the stories behind their products.


In Temecula Valley, Anderson said cannabis farmers would love to have tasting rooms just like the vineyards do. The county could permit such spaces, known generally as cannabis lounges, but hasn’t chosen to include that option in the proposed ordinance.


Competition is fierce


The industry overlap does pose some common challenges.


Labor costs are going up for growers of wine and cannabis, even as the size of the labor pool is shrinking, Drayton said, with the Trump administration’s immigration policies squeezing things even more.


“The wine industry has struggled with labor for a while,” said George Christie, president of the Wine Industry Network trade group. And with the growing cannabis industry able to offer some workers more money and better working conditions, he said, wineries are feeling the pinch.


Also, in many parts of the state, agricultural land is limited. And once a city or county votes to allow marijuana businesses, land values typically skyrocket, a phenomenon that has already forced out some wine growers.


In early 2017, San Francisco-based cannabis distributor Flow Kana announced it had purchased 80 acres in Redwood Valley that were once home to the Fetzer family winery. The company is transforming the property into Flow Cannabis Institute, which is being billed as a “one-stop facility” for marijuana processing, storage and distribution.


Ampelos Vineyard and Cellars in Lompoc said in its June 24 newsletter that they were moving after their landlord of 12 years got a “high offer” for their property from cannabis producers.


“Sad to see how this new business is rolling into the valley and taking over land and buildings,” wrote Ampelos’ owner Peter Work.


Those threats have come up during the Wine & Weed Symposium, a conference Christie’s group will host set for its second year in Santa Rosa on Aug. 2. But Christie said a “much larger percentage” of the conference’s roughly 500 attendees — including a number of “older, conservative wine industry people” — is interested in hearing about opportunities available in cannabis.


Christie sees overlap not just with business models between the industries, but also with the type of people they attract. Wine growers, he said, are typically hard-working, passionate, strategic entrepreneurs who aren’t afraid of a challenge. He sees many of the same qualities in cannabis entrepreneurs, he added, and nothing of the stoner stereotype he once expected.


“As that stigma sort of erodes,” he said, “there are more and more people in the wine industry that are kind of open to what opportunities this may bring.”


There are already wine growers in the Temecula area who are experimenting with small marijuana grows, according to Anderson. And he said there are many more entrepreneurs waiting on the sidelines, hoping the county will open the region to licensed marijuana businesses.


Laws limit overlap


The trend of literally mixing these two worlds by infusing wine with cannabis was becoming fashionable a couple years ago, with singer/cannabis entrepreneur Melissa Etheridge touting a “wine tincture” in her line of Etheridge Farms products.


Then California issued the first draft of its still-evolving rules for the marijuana industry. Those regulations included a strict ban on products that mix alcohol and cannabis and severely limited public events where marijuana is consumed, such as the wine and weed pairing dinners that had begun popping up everywhere.


Since cannabis remains illegal under federal law, wineries could also be jeopardizing their federal licenses if they start making or selling cannabis products on the same property.


“There are a bunch of people that thought they were going to go that road,” Anderson said. “That left a lot of broken dreams.”

Some companies, such as Hermosa Beach-based Rebel Coast Winery, are navigating the regulations by making cannabis-infused wine that’s alcohol-free. And event companies are trading infused dinners for tours that stop at both wineries and cannabis businesses.


Such ventures show that it doesn’t have to be a “zero sum game,” Christie said, where either the wine or the cannabis industry wins. And in Anderson’s view, they also show that marijuana entrepreneurs will work with any reasonable regulations that are thrown their way, including rules that he says could mitigate whatever safety, aesthetic or odor concerns neighbors might have.


That’s something he hopes Riverside County will take into consideration as officials write the playbook for how wine and weed will mix in Temecula Valley.

Brooke Edwards Staggs is a general assignment reporter with a focus on covering the politics, business, health and culture of cannabis. Journalism has led Staggs to a manhunt in Las Vegas, a zero gravity flight over Queens and a fishing village in Ghana. The Big Bear native is addicted to education. She earned her bachelors degree in English from California Baptist University, then got her master's in education as she taught high school English in the Inland Empire. After four years in the classroom, she left in 2006 to be a student again herself, earning a masters degree in journalism from New York University while interning and freelancing for a variety of publications. She sees journalism as another form of teaching, helping readers make informed decisions and better understand the world around them. Staggs spent five years as a staff writer then city editor at the Daily Press in Victorville. She won several awards for her work there, including best breaking news story from the California Newspaper Publishers Association for her tale of a teen who shot his father in a hunting accident.

On occasion, she also teaches community college and ghostwrites nonfiction books. Staggs loves dancing and new adventures. She hates water slides and injustice. If she doesn’t get right back to you, there’s a good chance she’s sitting with her DJ husband on a plane or train or boat destined for somewhere – anywhere – they’ve never been.

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 2:56 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 3:35 pm

In some regions of California, former vineyards are being converted to cannabis farms, wine conferences are having sessions about marijuana, and an up-and-coming job is cannabis sommelier.


While the wine and marijuana industries are similar in some ways, blending those worlds isn’t always easy. Winegrowers and cannabis cultivators increasingly square off over customers, land and workers. And lingering stigmas have kept some of the state’s wine-growing regions from being open to the newly legalized marijuana market.


Now it seems Temecula Valley Wine Country is on track to shut out the cannabis industry. Opposition from local winegrowers and government officials is making it unlikely that marijuana businesses will be allowed to operate in one of the most important agricultural and tourism regions in Riverside County.

“My fear is that you would see vineyards pushed out and there would be outdoor cultivation with chain-linked, barbed-wire fences,” said Danny Martin, board president for the Temecula Valley Winegrowers Association.


“We want to be the Temecula Valley Wine Country. We don’t want to become the Temecula Valley Weed Country.”


The message is clear, according to Micah Anderson, president of the cannabis cultivation trade group Southern California Responsible Growers Council.


“Wine is socially acceptable here,” Anderson said. “Cannabis isn’t.”


Ordinance carves out Temecula Valley


Though passage of Proposition 64 in 2016 made it legal in California for adults to consume cannabis, the law also gives cities and counties the authority to regulate most other marijuana activities within their borders.


All marijuana businesses are currently banned in unincorporated Riverside County. However, county leaders are considering an ordinance that would be among the most permissive in California, allowing businesses to grow, manufacture, test, distribute and sell marijuana products in most of the county’s unincorporated areas.


But, as proposed, the Riverside County ordinance would block marijuana businesses from two key areas — residential areas and the Temecula Valley Wine Country. The popular wine-tasting destination has a few dozen wineries spread over more than 17,000 acres of county-controlled land, just east of Temecula’s city limits.


Riverside County Planning Department staff said via email that cannabis cultivation is “not compatible” with the long-term planning for that area, which they said provides a “significant tourist attraction” and “economic benefit” to the region.


Supervisor Chuck Washington — whose district includes Temecula Valley and who once invested in an area winery — also opposes cannabis cultivation in the area because he doesn’t believe it would “further the goals” of the region, according to his chief of staff, Jeff Comerchero.


In a June 20 letter, Martin told Washington that the Temecula Valley Winegrowers Association board supported a ban on all commercial cannabis activities in wine country and asked the Board of Supervisors to “continue to deny all inconsistent land uses within this special agricultural area in our county.”


County staff said the first listed goal for the wine region is to “encourage agricultural cultivation.” Cannabis cultivation is an agricultural activity, Anderson said, with growers licensed by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. And cannabis, he added, should be treated as an agricultural product by local regulators.


But Martin insists that adding cannabis-related businesses in Temecula Valley Wine Country would be inconsistent with the existing zoning plan for the area.


Lessons learned


The wine and cannabis industries have coexisted for decades in places such as Mendocino and Sonoma counties, pointed out Josh Drayton, spokesman for the California Cannabis Industry Association.


But now that the state is licensing cannabis businesses for the first time, he said marijuana farmers can come out of the shadows to fight for the same rights and business opportunities wine growers have worked to secure.


“I think the cannabis industry has learned a lot from the wine industry,” Drayton said. “A lot of the challenges they have faced, and found solutions for, are guiding forces for our industry.”


That includes trying to brand cannabis products with appellations of origin. Meaning only marijuana grown in Humboldt County can have that label, just like only wines grown in Napa Valley can boast that origin.

Mom-and-pop wineries have also found creative ways to compete with bigger, corporate vineyards, Drayton said — a struggle that’s just starting for smaller and medium-sized marijuana growers. Transferable strategies might include tax incentives for small operators, boutique tours, paired dinners directed by sommeliers and direct-to-consumer sales that give owners a chance to sell the stories behind their products.


In Temecula Valley, Anderson said cannabis farmers would love to have tasting rooms just like the vineyards do. The county could permit such spaces, known generally as cannabis lounges, but hasn’t chosen to include that option in the proposed ordinance.


Competition is fierce


The industry overlap does pose some common challenges.


Labor costs are going up for growers of wine and cannabis, even as the size of the labor pool is shrinking, Drayton said, with the Trump administration’s immigration policies squeezing things even more.


“The wine industry has struggled with labor for a while,” said George Christie, president of the Wine Industry Network trade group. And with the growing cannabis industry able to offer some workers more money and better working conditions, he said, wineries are feeling the pinch.


Also, in many parts of the state, agricultural land is limited. And once a city or county votes to allow marijuana businesses, land values typically skyrocket, a phenomenon that has already forced out some wine growers.


In early 2017, San Francisco-based cannabis distributor Flow Kana announced it had purchased 80 acres in Redwood Valley that were once home to the Fetzer family winery. The company is transforming the property into Flow Cannabis Institute, which is being billed as a “one-stop facility” for marijuana processing, storage and distribution.


Ampelos Vineyard and Cellars in Lompoc said in its June 24 newsletter that they were moving after their landlord of 12 years got a “high offer” for their property from cannabis producers.


“Sad to see how this new business is rolling into the valley and taking over land and buildings,” wrote Ampelos’ owner Peter Work.


Those threats have come up during the Wine & Weed Symposium, a conference Christie’s group will host set for its second year in Santa Rosa on Aug. 2. But Christie said a “much larger percentage” of the conference’s roughly 500 attendees — including a number of “older, conservative wine industry people” — is interested in hearing about opportunities available in cannabis.


Christie sees overlap not just with business models between the industries, but also with the type of people they attract. Wine growers, he said, are typically hard-working, passionate, strategic entrepreneurs who aren’t afraid of a challenge. He sees many of the same qualities in cannabis entrepreneurs, he added, and nothing of the stoner stereotype he once expected.


“As that stigma sort of erodes,” he said, “there are more and more people in the wine industry that are kind of open to what opportunities this may bring.”


There are already wine growers in the Temecula area who are experimenting with small marijuana grows, according to Anderson. And he said there are many more entrepreneurs waiting on the sidelines, hoping the county will open the region to licensed marijuana businesses.


Laws limit overlap


The trend of literally mixing these two worlds by infusing wine with cannabis was becoming fashionable a couple years ago, with singer/cannabis entrepreneur Melissa Etheridge touting a “wine tincture” in her line of Etheridge Farms products.


Then California issued the first draft of its still-evolving rules for the marijuana industry. Those regulations included a strict ban on products that mix alcohol and cannabis and severely limited public events where marijuana is consumed, such as the wine and weed pairing dinners that had begun popping up everywhere.


Since cannabis remains illegal under federal law, wineries could also be jeopardizing their federal licenses if they start making or selling cannabis products on the same property.


“There are a bunch of people that thought they were going to go that road,” Anderson said. “That left a lot of broken dreams.”

Some companies, such as Hermosa Beach-based Rebel Coast Winery, are navigating the regulations by making cannabis-infused wine that’s alcohol-free. And event companies are trading infused dinners for tours that stop at both wineries and cannabis businesses.


Such ventures show that it doesn’t have to be a “zero sum game,” Christie said, where either the wine or the cannabis industry wins. And in Anderson’s view, they also show that marijuana entrepreneurs will work with any reasonable regulations that are thrown their way, including rules that he says could mitigate whatever safety, aesthetic or odor concerns neighbors might have.


That’s something he hopes Riverside County will take into consideration as officials write the playbook for how wine and weed will mix in Temecula Valley.

Raudel Felix García of Fontana thought someone was playing a cruel joke on him when he was told a decade ago that his brother had died after working in the grape fields of Kern County.


Audon Felix García had arrived from Zacatecas, Mexico just days before to work in the fields as he had done every other summer, his brother said. But the 41-year-old died two days after starting work loading boxes on the company truck, he said, due to temperatures that reached 112 degrees that summer day and employer “negligence” to properly care for him.


“It was hard to believe that he was simply gone,” a highly emotional Raudel Felix García, who owns his own landscaping business, said Tuesday in a media teleconference. “I had seen Audon five days before his death. He was healthy and ready to start another harvesting season.”

Now, Raudel Felix García is among those who are calling for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to establish the first federal standard that would protect workers from exposure to excessive heat.


“I don’t want any more families to go through the pain that my family went through,” he said.

More than 100 labor, public health, environmental justice and environmental groups along with former occupational regulators and other individual petitioners submitted a petition to the federal agency calling for national protections for workers – both indoor and outdoor – who are at risk from extreme heat.


It marks the launch of a national campaign by the consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen, the United Farm Workers Foundation and Farmworker Justice and others in an effort to raise awareness about the effects of climate change on workers’ health and safety.


“Preventing heat illness is urgently needed now more than ever,” Ellen Widess, a former Cal/OSHA chief and a board member of Farmworker Justice, said on the call. “Given climate change, rising heat, high-heat incidents and expanding areas of California and the nation which experience high heat, we have to do something.”


U.S. Rep. Judy Chu, D-Pasadena, said she plans to introduce legislation in Congress that would require the federal government to develop federal heat protection standards. These standards would likely require employers to provide workplaces with water, shade and rest breaks if needed to recover from the heat, similar to what California already requires.


The planned legislation would also direct employers to provide training for employees about risk factors that can lead to heat illness, Chu said.


“All workers should benefit from safe conditions whenever they work outside in the heat no matter where they are,” she said.

Locally, the issue of working in extreme heat gained attention recently after U.S. postal carrier Peggy Frank, 63, was found dead July 6 in her mail truck on a 117-degree day in Woodland Hills. Authorities, including OSHA, are probing whether heat was a factor.


Employers are obligated to protect employees from any hazardous condition, including potential heat stress, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.


In the case of the U.S. Postal Service, carriers are reminded daily to stay hydrated throughout their route, wear appropriate clothing, such as hats, and get into the shade whenever and as much as possible, officials said.


In 2005, after a series of farmworker deaths, California became the first state in the country to issue comprehensive heat standard protections for workers. Those regulations were strengthened a decade later and have likely saved lives, activists and experts say.


While there have been some tragic cases of heat-related deaths in the state since then, Chu said it’s probably related to enforcement of the state’s regulations.


“We feel it’s related to whether there are people being sent out to see whether employers are really doing their job and whether they are holding them accountable,” she said.


Chu added that she’s hopeful that the new legislation will tackle this problem.

That sentiment was echoed by Widess, the former Cal/Osha chief, who said that even in a state like California, it’s important to increase enforcement capacity of regulatory agencies.


“More inspectors are needed to make sure employers are doing right by workers, taking every step needed, and OSHA is chronically understaffed nationally,” she said.

Raudel Felix García of Fontana thought someone was playing a cruel joke on him when he was told a decade ago that his brother had died after working in the grape fields of Kern County.

But the 41-year-old died two days after starting work loading boxes on the company truck, he said, due to temperatures that reached 112 degrees that summer day and employer “negligence” to properly care for him.

Yet another music festival has staked a claim in Southern California this fall. The new Same Same But Different festival will launch at Lake Perris State Recreation Area on Sept. 22-23.


The inaugural two-day music and arts festival features acts such as Lettuce, Boombox, Through The Roots and The Family Crest on Saturday while Sunday’s lineup features Moon Hooch, The Floozies and Fashion Jackson.


Although there will be two stages, only one stage at a time will have performances to avoid fans having to deal with overlapping set times, festival organizers said in a news release.


And with the event taking place at Lake Perris, festival goers can take advantage of the location and go hiking, biking, boating or swimming. RV and car camping passes are available as well. The poster for the event also boasts yoga and interactive art.

Tickets are on sale now and a general admission pass for the two-day fest is $125. RV camping is $65; car camping is $40; parking is $10.

Yet another music festival has staked a claim in Southern California this fall. The new Same Same But Different festival will launch at Lake Perris State Recreation Area on Sept. 22-23.


The inaugural two-day music and arts festival features acts such as Lettuce, Boombox, Through The Roots and The Family Crest on Saturday while Sunday’s lineup features Moon Hooch, The Floozies and Fashion Jackson.


Although there will be two stages, only one stage at a time will have performances to avoid fans having to deal with overlapping set times, festival organizers said in a news release.


And with the event taking place at Lake Perris, festival goers can take advantage of the location and go hiking, biking, boating or swimming. RV and car camping passes are available as well. The poster for the event also boasts yoga and interactive art.

By Kelli Skye Fadroski | kfadroski@scng.com | Orange County Register

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 12:58 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 12:59 pm

Normally when Face to Face frontman Trever Keith hits the stage, it’s wild. Spit and sweat are flying everywhere, fans are passionately screaming along to Keith’s vocals, moshing hard in the pit and crowd surfing, hurling their flailing bodies over the barrier.


For this upcoming tour, however, things will be a bit different as the Victorville-based punk rock band has stripped down and rearranged some of its biggest hits and fan favorites that span the quartet’s 27-year career for its first acoustic album titled “Hold Fast,” which will be released Friday, July 27 via Fat Wreck Chords.


The album will be supported by a full tour, which includes three Southern California stops, starting at Hotel Cafe in Los Angeles on Wednesday, July 25, then the Observatory in Santa Ana on Thursday, July 26 and Romano’s Concert Lounge in Riverside on Sunday, July 29. All of the shows will feature opener Cory Branan, however the Orange County stop will also include acoustic sets by Jason Cruz of Strung Out and Scott Russo of Unwritten Law.


Following the success of the acoustic and unplugged albums and singles issued by bands such as Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains, a lot of artists were getting asked to follow suit. However when Keith was approached about it in the late ’90s and early ’00s, he wasn’t interested because it didn’t seem like the punk rock thing to do.


“I resisted for a very long time because we were a punk rock band and it just didn’t fit,” Keith said during a recent phone interview. “But, last year we did a tour and we offered one of our very first VIP packages and as part of that package I wanted to give something extra for the value and we decided to bring some acoustic guitars and do these little acoustic sets. Something just clicked. I don’t know if it was the relative age of us in the band and our fans and the place where we seem to be at in life, or if it’s the current climate of music or the culture, but it reacted very well with the audience and we were surprisingly really enjoying ourselves playing to them.”


After 27 years, these short acoustic sets gave the band a new artistic outlet and the path cleared very organically, Keith insists, as the VIP sessions led to the band wanting to record a few versions of the songs and commit to this alter ego of Face to Face, which would blossom into an album and a tour.

“This is something new that we are embracing,” he said. “As a band, we’ve done one-off things here and there acoustically, but we are committing to it on this tour and we’re starting things off here in our own backyard. As a Southern California band, we wanted to go to our family and our fans that have supported us since the ’90s and then there are more dates in September that bring us throughout the rest of the country as well. But we are committing to this and it’s not just like a novelty.”


The songs started out as a quick punk rock set with the guys pounding away on acoustic guitars, keeping the rhythms and maintaining the heaviness. Over the last year, Keith said they began to refine them and even took to social media to ask their loyal followers the top five songs they’d like to hear acoustic. At first, the band was going to stay far away from “Disconnected,” arguably its biggest hit, as well as the fast-paced “Ordinary.”


“People really wanted to hear ‘Disconnected’ and we were like, ‘OK, fine’,” Keith said with a laugh. “But actually, what we ended up recording and putting out on record came out really cool. I’m happy that we did take those requests to heart and challenged ourselves to make versions of those because ‘Ordinary’ was another one that I sat there like ‘How in the hell are we going to do that acoustic?’ It just didn’t make sense, but through a little re-thinking and re-imagining we were able to trump up a version and it ended up coming out great.”


A few of the other tracks, including “Don’t Turn Away” and “A-OK,” were given a bit of an Americana and country music vibe with the inclusion of a steel guitar. Keith said living in Nashville for a time did help him visualize how that style of music could fit, however, it was guitarist Dennis Hill and drummer Danny Thompson that had a lot to do with the introduction of that style.


“Dennis came up with at riff for ‘A-OK’ and I was resistant to it, like ‘Dude, we can’t go down this road,’ but then Danny came up with this beat and it was totally like Black Crowes when it started and I was like ‘I can’t do this,” Keith said. “It wasn’t a matter of if it was going too far or not, it was whether I feel comfortable and feel like I can be part of making that song and if it’s something authentic to the kind of music I’d like to make. I just wasn’t feeling it, but we kept hammering away at it until we had a version that everyone felt comfortable representing themselves as a player.”


Though a few of the songs dance in and out of the Americana and country genres, Keith said a lot of the influence on the record actually came from some of his favorite ’80s bands such as the Cure, the Smiths and the Psychedelic Furs.


“A lot of the simple songwriting comes from the love of those types of songs,” he said. “When I say that people might think I’m crazy because they picture the synthesizers and drum machines, but it’s not about the instrumentation, it’s about the way the songs are written and they’re simple pop songs. A lot of that has the same kind of sensibility too and the melancholy that comes with that. Maybe we’ve created a problem for ourselves in that there are a lot of different influences there so it may be hard for people to define ultimately. But it all lives in a place that is uniquely ours and hopefully that’s something people will be able to recognize and I’m hoping that’s a positive for us at the end of the day.”


To be clear, Keith said this is not the new “way” of Face to Face. The band will still get out there and melt faces at punk rock shows, however showcasing this style of performance could further open up its members to playing festivals and touring with acts they’d previously been passed up for.


If they hadn’t made this record, Keith said, they’d never have been asked to play with Lucero and Frank Turner at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado on Aug. 3.


“I mean, it’s also maybe a little bit of a retirement plan for us in a strange way,” he explained. “Not retiring from music, but playing punk rock is very physically demanding and if we want to be able to do this until we fall over and die it might be easier to do a few more of the acoustic shows and a few less of the punk rock shows as we age into the future. Hopefully that’s something that makes sense for us and for our fans, too.”

By Kelli Skye Fadroski | kfadroski@scng.com | Orange County Register

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 12:58 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 12:59 pm

Normally when Face to Face frontman Trever Keith hits the stage, it’s wild. Spit and sweat are flying everywhere, fans are passionately screaming along to Keith’s vocals, moshing hard in the pit and crowd surfing, hurling their flailing bodies over the barrier.


For this upcoming tour, however, things will be a bit different as the Victorville-based punk rock band has stripped down and rearranged some of its biggest hits and fan favorites that span the quartet’s 27-year career for its first acoustic album titled “Hold Fast,” which will be released Friday, July 27 via Fat Wreck Chords.


The album will be supported by a full tour, which includes three Southern California stops, starting at Hotel Cafe in Los Angeles on Wednesday, July 25, then the Observatory in Santa Ana on Thursday, July 26 and Romano’s Concert Lounge in Riverside on Sunday, July 29. All of the shows will feature opener Cory Branan, however the Orange County stop will also include acoustic sets by Jason Cruz of Strung Out and Scott Russo of Unwritten Law.


Following the success of the acoustic and unplugged albums and singles issued by bands such as Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains, a lot of artists were getting asked to follow suit. However when Keith was approached about it in the late ’90s and early ’00s, he wasn’t interested because it didn’t seem like the punk rock thing to do.


“I resisted for a very long time because we were a punk rock band and it just didn’t fit,” Keith said during a recent phone interview. “But, last year we did a tour and we offered one of our very first VIP packages and as part of that package I wanted to give something extra for the value and we decided to bring some acoustic guitars and do these little acoustic sets. Something just clicked. I don’t know if it was the relative age of us in the band and our fans and the place where we seem to be at in life, or if it’s the current climate of music or the culture, but it reacted very well with the audience and we were surprisingly really enjoying ourselves playing to them.”


After 27 years, these short acoustic sets gave the band a new artistic outlet and the path cleared very organically, Keith insists, as the VIP sessions led to the band wanting to record a few versions of the songs and commit to this alter ego of Face to Face, which would blossom into an album and a tour.

“This is something new that we are embracing,” he said. “As a band, we’ve done one-off things here and there acoustically, but we are committing to it on this tour and we’re starting things off here in our own backyard. As a Southern California band, we wanted to go to our family and our fans that have supported us since the ’90s and then there are more dates in September that bring us throughout the rest of the country as well. But we are committing to this and it’s not just like a novelty.”


The songs started out as a quick punk rock set with the guys pounding away on acoustic guitars, keeping the rhythms and maintaining the heaviness. Over the last year, Keith said they began to refine them and even took to social media to ask their loyal followers the top five songs they’d like to hear acoustic. At first, the band was going to stay far away from “Disconnected,” arguably its biggest hit, as well as the fast-paced “Ordinary.”


“People really wanted to hear ‘Disconnected’ and we were like, ‘OK, fine’,” Keith said with a laugh. “But actually, what we ended up recording and putting out on record came out really cool. I’m happy that we did take those requests to heart and challenged ourselves to make versions of those because ‘Ordinary’ was another one that I sat there like ‘How in the hell are we going to do that acoustic?’ It just didn’t make sense, but through a little re-thinking and re-imagining we were able to trump up a version and it ended up coming out great.”


A few of the other tracks, including “Don’t Turn Away” and “A-OK,” were given a bit of an Americana and country music vibe with the inclusion of a steel guitar. Keith said living in Nashville for a time did help him visualize how that style of music could fit, however, it was guitarist Dennis Hill and drummer Danny Thompson that had a lot to do with the introduction of that style.


“Dennis came up with at riff for ‘A-OK’ and I was resistant to it, like ‘Dude, we can’t go down this road,’ but then Danny came up with this beat and it was totally like Black Crowes when it started and I was like ‘I can’t do this,” Keith said. “It wasn’t a matter of if it was going too far or not, it was whether I feel comfortable and feel like I can be part of making that song and if it’s something authentic to the kind of music I’d like to make. I just wasn’t feeling it, but we kept hammering away at it until we had a version that everyone felt comfortable representing themselves as a player.”


Though a few of the songs dance in and out of the Americana and country genres, Keith said a lot of the influence on the record actually came from some of his favorite ’80s bands such as the Cure, the Smiths and the Psychedelic Furs.


“A lot of the simple songwriting comes from the love of those types of songs,” he said. “When I say that people might think I’m crazy because they picture the synthesizers and drum machines, but it’s not about the instrumentation, it’s about the way the songs are written and they’re simple pop songs. A lot of that has the same kind of sensibility too and the melancholy that comes with that. Maybe we’ve created a problem for ourselves in that there are a lot of different influences there so it may be hard for people to define ultimately. But it all lives in a place that is uniquely ours and hopefully that’s something people will be able to recognize and I’m hoping that’s a positive for us at the end of the day.”


To be clear, Keith said this is not the new “way” of Face to Face. The band will still get out there and melt faces at punk rock shows, however showcasing this style of performance could further open up its members to playing festivals and touring with acts they’d previously been passed up for.


If they hadn’t made this record, Keith said, they’d never have been asked to play with Lucero and Frank Turner at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado on Aug. 3.


“I mean, it’s also maybe a little bit of a retirement plan for us in a strange way,” he explained. “Not retiring from music, but playing punk rock is very physically demanding and if we want to be able to do this until we fall over and die it might be easier to do a few more of the acoustic shows and a few less of the punk rock shows as we age into the future. Hopefully that’s something that makes sense for us and for our fans, too.”

A lightning strike is seen Wednesday, July 18, 2018, in Van Nuys as a storm cell moves west over the Santa Monica Mountains south of the San Fernando Valley. Lighting strikes started some small spot fire in the hills, and local beaches were closed down due to lightning till the storm cells move out of the area.

LOS ANGELES — A cluster of thunderstorms rolled slowly across the Southland Wednesday, bringing bursts of rain that dampened streets and lightning strikes that prompted the closure of beaches in Santa Monica and Malibu, and may have started a couple small fires in Encino.


Fueled by a flow of monsoonal moisture, the storms moved from east to west across the area, with rain and thunder reported in the San Gabriel Valley before the precipitation arrived in the West Los Angeles and West Hollywood area around 11:30 a.m.


Rain was also reported in Burbank and other valley areas. Los Angeles Fire Department crews responded to a pair of small brush fires in the Encino area around the time the storm rolled in, prompting speculation that lightning strikes were to blame.

And a tree may have been hit on Sunset Boulevard near the beach.


On Topanga Canyon Boulevard, a car flipped on its side in the heavy rain just up from the beach. No one was injured, the CHP said.


Lightning was spotted in the Santa Monica area, prompting the city to issue an evacuation order for the ocean and beach areas. Authorities warned people to seek shelter indoors until the storm passed.


The National Weather Service shared this image on Twitter of a cluster of thunderstorms about 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, July 18, 2018, over an area extending from West Hollywood to Santa Monica and moving west toward Topanga and Malibu.

National Weather Service officials echoed that advice, with a Twitter post saying, “When thunder roars go indoors.”


Los Angeles County lifeguards also closed beaches between Malibu and Zuma due to lightning. As of 12:40 p.m., all beaches in Malibu were closed, the city of Malibu reported.


Thunderstorms are dangerous on the beach because sand “is a known conductor of electricity generated by lightning strikes in the ocean,” the city said on its web site.


After the storm cells passed through the area, with no additional cells expected, LA County lifeguards reopened Malibu’s beaches about 1:30 p.m., the city reported on Twitter.


Rainfall was concentrated in the Hollywood Hills and west into the Santa Monica Mountains. Totals included .17 inch at UCLA and .09 inches in Topanga Canyon.


Forecasters said warm and humid conditions were expected to continue into Wednesday afternoon, with a slight chance of additional thunderstorms lingering into Wednesday evening.

SANTA CLARITA — A woman was in custody Wednesday, accused of leading California Highway Patrol officers on a chase along the northbound 5 Freeway from the San Diego area to Santa Clarita.


The chase began about 7:30 p.m. Tuesday on westbound state Route 52, approaching state Route 125 in Santee when officers tried to pull over the driver of a Nissan Rogue SUV for speeding, according to Officer M. Bailey of the California Highway Patrol’s San Diego Office.


The pursuit traveled north for nearly three hours until the vehicle drove over spike strips deployed by officers near the McBean Parkway exit, NBC4 reported.


The driver stopped the SUV in the middle lane of the freeway near Magic Mountain Parkway, and officers moved in, pulled her from the vehicle and took her into custody.


The rear of the SUV was damaged from non-lethal rounds fired by officers in an attempt to get the driver to surrender, NBC4 said.


Throughout the chase, the driver used her turn signals when changing lanes.


KCAL9 reported the driver may not have been the registered owner of the SUV.

Searchers on Tuesday, July 17, continued to look for a 51-year-old Canada resident who disappeared while hiking at Joshua Tree National Park.


Paul Miller was last seen by his wife about 9 a.m. Friday when he left for a hike on the 49 Palms Oasis trail. She reported him overdue about noon. His car was found in the parking lot at the trailhead.

Joshua Tree National Park Search and Rescue and the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department are participating in the search, according to the park’s Facebook page.


A friend, Ainsley Otten, said on the Facebook page that Miller is “a fairly experienced outdoorsman and was likely more prepared than most.”


The trail and parking lot are closed to the public during the search.


Officials ask that anyone with information on Miller’s whereabouts or who has any other helpful details call 909-383-5651.

Searchers on Tuesday, July 17, continued to look for a 51-year-old Canada resident who disappeared while hiking at Joshua Tree National Park.


Paul Miller was last seen by his wife about 9 a.m. Friday when he left for a hike on the 49 Palms Oasis trail. She reported him overdue about noon. His car was found in the parking lot at the trailhead.

Joshua Tree National Park Search and Rescue and the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department are participating in the search, according to the park’s Facebook page.


A friend, Ainsley Otten, said on the Facebook page that Miller is “a fairly experienced outdoorsman and was likely more prepared than most.”


The trail and parking lot are closed to the public during the search.


Officials ask that anyone with information on Miller’s whereabouts or who has any other helpful details call 909-383-5651.

RIVERSIDE — A 22-year-old Canyon Lake man who blasted his best friend with a shotgun in Moreno Valley in what the prosecution argued was a case of intimate feelings gone sour was convicted Tuesday of second-degree murder.


After three days of deliberations, a Riverside jury found Houston Michael Boji guilty of the Nov. 10, 2015, shooting death of 18-year-old Nicholas McCauley of Moreno Valley.


Houston Michael Boji<br />File photo

The jury also found true sentence-enhancing gun and great bodily injury allegations, and Boji is expected to be sentenced on Sept. 7 to 40 years to life in state prison.


Deputy District Attorney Sharunne Foster argued that Boji intended to kill McCauley and telegraphed his intentions well in advance with threatening texts, including one stating, “I’m serious. I will shoot you when I see you mother(expletive).”


She theorized that Boji had developed passionate feelings for his longtime friend, with whom he socialized almost daily, and became incensed when McCauley did not reciprocate.


The defendant and victim had spent time with each other four days before the Nov. 10, 2015, shooting, and Boji ended up with a cold sore afterward, which the prosecution suggested was the result of intimate contact.


When Boji texted complaints to McCauley regarding his physical discomfort and unhappiness, the victim evidently did not respond, igniting anger in the defendant, who vowed to shoot McCauley the next time they met, according to the prosecution.


Sheriff’s investigators said Boji armed himself with a fully loaded 12-gauge pump shotgun and went to his friend’s residence in the 25000 block of Soaring Seagull Lane, waited until the victim’s mother left for work, then slipped into the house, where McCauley was still asleep in his bedroom.


Boji fired one round into McCauley’s left arm at close range — so close that the buckshot dispersed throughout the sleeping victim’s entire chest cavity, killing him on the spot, according to the prosecution.

The defendant initially told detectives that McCauley had killed himself, but in succeeding statements admitted firing the shot.


According to Boji’s attorneys, he never wanted to kill the victim. The defense argued that there were no homosexual impulses, and that Boji was only interested in scaring McCauley because of a minor dispute, without realizing the shotgun was loaded.


Boji has no documented prior felony convictions.

The jury also found true sentence-enhancing gun and great bodily injury allegations, and Boji is expected to be sentenced on Sept. 7 to 40 years to life in state prison.


Deputy District Attorney Sharunne Foster argued that Boji intended to kill McCauley and telegraphed his intentions well in advance with threatening texts, including one stating, “I’m serious. I will shoot you when I see you mother(expletive).”


She theorized that Boji had developed passionate feelings for his longtime friend, with whom he socialized almost daily, and became incensed when McCauley did not reciprocate.


The defendant and victim had spent time with each other four days before the Nov. 10, 2015, shooting, and Boji ended up with a cold sore afterward, which the prosecution suggested was the result of intimate contact.


When Boji texted complaints to McCauley regarding his physical discomfort and unhappiness, the victim evidently did not respond, igniting anger in the defendant, who vowed to shoot McCauley the next time they met, according to the prosecution.


Sheriff’s investigators said Boji armed himself with a fully loaded 12-gauge pump shotgun and went to his friend’s residence in the 25000 block of Soaring Seagull Lane, waited until the victim’s mother left for work, then slipped into the house, where McCauley was still asleep in his bedroom.


Boji fired one round into McCauley’s left arm at close range — so close that the buckshot dispersed throughout the sleeping victim’s entire chest cavity, killing him on the spot, according to the prosecution.

The defendant initially told detectives that McCauley had killed himself, but in succeeding statements admitted firing the shot.


According to Boji’s attorneys, he never wanted to kill the victim. The defense argued that there were no homosexual impulses, and that Boji was only interested in scaring McCauley because of a minor dispute, without realizing the shotgun was loaded.


Boji has no documented prior felony convictions.

This story corrects a previous version that incorrectly stated that a CHP unit crashed.


The two right lanes of the westbound 60 Freeway in Ontario were closed early Friday afternoon, July 6, after an Ontario police unit collided with a tow truck, the California Highway Patrol said.


A tractor-trailer also was involved in the collision, which was reported just before noon, according to the CHP incident log. All lanes were initially closed.

Both officers were out of the patrol car.


“Both officers are okay because they were wearing their seatbelts,” Police Chief Derek Williams said.


There was no immediate word on injuries to others.


The CHP is investigating the collision.

This story corrects a previous version that incorrectly stated that a CHP unit crashed.


The two right lanes of the westbound 60 Freeway in Ontario were closed early Friday afternoon, July 6, after an Ontario police unit collided with a tow truck, the California Highway Patrol said.


A tractor-trailer also was involved in the collision, which was reported just before noon, according to the CHP incident log. All lanes were initially closed.

Both officers were out of the patrol car.


“Both officers are okay because they were wearing their seatbelts,” Police Chief Derek Williams said.


There was no immediate word on injuries to others.


The CHP is investigating the collision.

Two small brush fires along the northbound 15 Freeway in the Cajon Pass Wednesday afternoon prompted California Highway Patrol officials to shut down lanes of traffic and issued a SigAlert, according to initial CHP reports.


The fires were first reported around 11:30 a.m. near Kenwood Drive.


U.S. Forest Service fire crews and air support responded to this fire. The rate of spread has stopped. Total of four acres between two small fires near Kenwood and the I-15. https://t.co/ySj2nvfNcC

The two wildfires scorched a combined 4 acres before firefighters managed to stop it’s forward spread, according to National Forest Service authorities.

Two small brush fires along the northbound 15 Freeway in the Cajon Pass Wednesday afternoon prompted California Highway Patrol officials to shut down lanes of traffic and issued a SigAlert, according to initial CHP reports.


The fires were first reported around 11:30 a.m. near Kenwood Drive.


U.S. Forest Service fire crews and air support responded to this fire. The rate of spread has stopped. Total of four acres between two small fires near Kenwood and the I-15. https://t.co/ySj2nvfNcC

PUBLISHED: June 25, 2018 at 2:27 pm | UPDATED: June 25, 2018 at 6:05 pm

Setting the stage for a major statewide battle over how to pay for an estimated $67 billion backlog in highway, bridge and road repairs, a ballot measure to repeal California’s recently enacted gas taxes and registration fees officially qualified Monday for the November ballot.


Already, Gov. Jerry Brown and a powerful coalition of chambers of commerce, law enforcement, unions, firefighters, local transportation agencies and cities and counties have vowed to fight it.


“I will do everything in my power to defeat any repeal effort,” Brown said in a statement shortly after the Secretary of State’s Office announced the effort had qualified for the ballot. “You can count on that.”


John Cox, the Republican candidate for governor, didn’t waste any time, either, to voice his support for the repeal.


“This is a message to the millions of forgotten Californians ignored by the Sacramento political elite, help is on the way,” Cox said. “Let this also be a message to every special interest in Sacramento, we’re coming for you.”


The taxes and fees have strong support in the Bay Area, according to a recent USC and Los Angeles Times poll, where a booming economy has driven up the price of housing, forcing workers to commute longer distances through maddening traffic and where 72 percent of likely voters said they would keep the tax.


But that enthusiasm would not be enough to retain the tax, the poll found, because support is weak nearly everywhere else. Only 38 percent of Los Angeles-area voters, 29 percent of voters elsewhere in Southern California, and 30 percent of Central Valley voters support it.


Without the new taxes and fees, California residents will be stuck right back where they started, with not enough money to fund needed highway maintenance, road repairs or public transit upgrades, said repeal opponent Carl Guardino, the CEO of the business-focused Silicon Valley Leadership Group and a member of the California Transportation Commission.


“Those stating we can fund those improvements without the funds generated from California’s first gas tax increase in 25 years are either mistaken or are flat-out misleading California voters,” he said via email. “If this misleading repeal is successful in November, more than half of those improvements grind to a halt, along with our region’s economy and quality of life.”


Already, more than 5,000 state and local transportation projects are underway using money generated from the new taxes and fees, according to the California Transportation Commission. State transportation officials estimate roughly half of those projects would be delayed or indefinitely deferred if the repeal succeeds, including $3.1 billion for transit and highway projects in the Bay Area alone.


Approved by the legislature and signed into law last year, Senate Bill 1, which went into effect in November, raised the tax on gasoline by 12 cents per gallon and increased the tax on diesel by 20 cents per gallon. It also raised registration fees this year by $25 to $175, depending on the value of the vehicle, and imposed a $100 registration fee for zero-emission vehicles, which will go into effect in 2020.


The taxes and fees are expected to generate roughly $54 billion over the next 10 years to chip away at the state’s deferred maintenance backlog and help pay for upgrades to public transit. The increases nearly double the amount cities and counties receive annually to repair local streets and roads.


Opponents of the tax say the state has poorly managed the transportation money it already has. Too often over the past 20 years, they say, politicians raided transportation funding to balance the state’s budget, limiting the state’s ability to pay for highway and road maintenance, which only made the eventual repairs more expensive.


It’s hard to get a good accounting of how much money was diverted and how much has been repaid, said David Wolfe, the legislative director at the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which opposes the taxes and fees. A 2016 UCLA report cited at least three times in the mid-1990s and 2000s when the state used money to balance the budget that was supposed to repair highways and roads or upgrade public transit.


Changes to the state constitution now prohibit such transfers in most cases.


Wolfe highlighted another redirection of transportation funding: Voters approved several general obligation bonds over the years to pay for large transportation projects with the expectation that the principal would be paid from the general fund. But a complicated funding measure called the “Gas Tax Swap” enabled legislators to use truck weight fees, which previously paid for highway and road maintenance, to pay off transportation-related debt, instead. That amounts to about $7 billion since the swap went into effect.


“The roads will not get fixed because the politicians will continue to divert the funds as they always have in the past,” Carl DeMaio, who is leading the repeal effort, said in a statement Monday. The Legislative Analyst’s Office estimates that, with the new taxes, the average driver will pay $750 per year in taxes and fees.


But proponents note that the last time the gas tax was raised was in 1994, when it increased from 9 cents to 18 cents, and argue that it’s due for an increase. It’s not hard to see how the backlog of deferred maintenance grew, said Martin Wachs, an urban planning professor emeritus at UCLA, when you consider seismic retrofit projects that lengthened the list of needed repairs statewide, and several recessions that reduced the money the state anticipated collecting.


Even if money dedicated to transportation was diverted to the general fund, for the most part, it’s been repaid, he said.


“It’s also true that the occasions when that has been done have been really rare and have occurred in times of fiscal emergency,” Wachs said. “The main problem is the lack of buying power of the gas tax, unless it is raised, to keep up with inflation.”

* Authorities report a two-mile-long multi-vehicle accident in dense fog in the Cajon Pass (Courtesy San Bernardino County Fire Department)
By Richard K. De Atley | rdeatley@scng.com | The Press-Enterprise

PUBLISHED: May 30, 2018 at 12:27 pm | UPDATED: May 30, 2018 at 6:09 pm

A chain-collision of vehicles in dense fog Wednesday turned a stretch of the southbound 15 Freeway in the Cajon Pass into a mile-long trail of crumpled cars, injured multiple people, and stuck motorists in a backup that stretched 10 miles at one point, authorities said.


The fog will be back in the pass Thursday, the National Weather Service said. Electronic billboards in the area will warn motorists to slow down, but they should “avoid travel if they can,” said Caltrans spokeswoman Terri Kasinga. “It’s not safe driving in the fog.”


San Bernardino County Fire Department reported 17 injuries from the scene, and the California Highway Patrol incident log said eight people were sent to hospitals. Firefighters also said there were “numerous drivers and occupants declining treatment.” None of the injuries was life-threatening, the CHP said.


The crashes started at 10:42 a.m. when two vehicles heading southbound on the freeway were disabled in a collision south of Oak Hill Road, blocking lanes of traffic and starting a chain reaction of crashes, the CHP said in a release. A SigAlert was called.

The southbound lanes were eventually all closed with all gradually reopening by 1:20 p.m. The affected area was roughly from south of Oak Hill Road to north of the brake check area — there are few landmarks where the crashes occurred — CHP Officer Marcelo Llerena said.


“There were multiple separate collisions, it’s about a mile long,” Llerena said by phone. “There were a lot of two-or-three-or-four car (collisions),” he said.


Fire officials said traffic was backed up to Main Street in Hesperia due to the collisons, which Llerena said was a 10-mile lineup.


Between 20 to 30 cars were estimated to be involved, but the CHP said Wednesday afternoon it was still counting how many cars and people were involved in the various wrecks.


Amid the confusion, a CHP officer helped two stranded graduating seniors from Mojave High School in Hesperia by giving them a lift to their graduation at the Glen Helen Amphitheater near Devore, CHP Officer Brian Alvarez said.

At the time of the crashes, the CHP said visibility in the area was about 30 feet.


“Unfortunately, we are going to do it all over again,” NWS-San Diego meteorologist Dan Gregoria said Wednesday. He said the marine layer from the coast will be strong enough to again push into the Cajon Pass, rolling in overnight and staying until late Thursday morning.


“It could be severe, with restrictions in visibility,” Gregoria said. “Slow down and leave a good distance between you and other drivers.” Gregoria said the pattern will change for the weekend, with the marine layer more shallow and less likely to reach the Inland area.


The CHP asked anyone with information about the incident to call their San Bernardino office at (909) 383-4247.


Northbound traffic didn’t stop, but was slow because of the fog and the distraction of the pileups in the southbound lanes, Llerena said. The CHP had 16 to 17 units at the scene to help clear the lanes and control traffic, among other work.

* Rain hit parts of Los Angeles Wednesday afternoon.
By Angela Ratzlaff |

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 1:38 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 2:20 pm

You could say Los Angeles is a stranger to rain, especially during the summertime.


So when some droplets and a few strikes of lightning hit around the Hollywood area early Wednesday afternoon – in the middle of July – locals couldn’t believe what they were seeing.


There is, however, an explanation for this rare occurrence. It’s monsoon season and the result is muggy moisture in Southern California.


Increasing monsoonal moisture will bring a threat of thunderstorms to portions of SW Calif Wed into Thu. Greatest threats will be brief heavy downpours with isolated flash flooding as well as strong wind gusts. #LAWeather #LArain #cawx #Socal pic.twitter.com/awWdL55tgZ

Parts of Los Angeles started seeing rain at around 11 a.m.

At 1220pm, showers and thunderstorms have moved west from Malibu and off the coast south of Anacapa and Santa Cruz Islands. Please wait 30 minutes after last thunder before leaving your home or car. Storms are moving quickly WSW at 30 mph. #LARain #LAWeather #CAwx pic.twitter.com/P9MxiaOjIs

Around 1 p.m., Malibu even issued a warning and closed its beaches due to safety concerns.


All #Malibu beaches are closed due to lightning. LA County Lifeguards closed and cleared beaches at 12:40 PM due to public safety concerns about lightning moving from Santa Monica through Malibu. Lifeguards are expected to re-open beaches later today. https://t.co/fLzBfZLw6u pic.twitter.com/SzI4QMqHNy

But since the rain affected small pockets of Los Angeles, a lot of people got jealous that they didn’t see any water fall from the sky.

* Rain hit parts of Los Angeles Wednesday afternoon.
By Angela Ratzlaff |

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 1:38 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 2:20 pm

You could say Los Angeles is a stranger to rain, especially during the summertime.


So when some droplets and a few strikes of lightning hit around the Hollywood area early Wednesday afternoon – in the middle of July – locals couldn’t believe what they were seeing.


There is, however, an explanation for this rare occurrence. It’s monsoon season and the result is muggy moisture in Southern California.


Increasing monsoonal moisture will bring a threat of thunderstorms to portions of SW Calif Wed into Thu. Greatest threats will be brief heavy downpours with isolated flash flooding as well as strong wind gusts. #LAWeather #LArain #cawx #Socal pic.twitter.com/awWdL55tgZ

Parts of Los Angeles started seeing rain at around 11 a.m.

* A National Weather Service radar analysis shows how much rain fell in the San Bernardino Mountains through 3 p.m. Wednesday, July 11, 2018. The highest total was 2.8 inches just west of Big Bear Lake and north of Highway 18. (Image via National Weather Service)

PUBLISHED: July 11, 2018 at 1:23 pm | UPDATED: July 11, 2018 at 8:34 pm

A 7-mile stretch of Highway 18 near Big Bear in the San Bernardino Mountains was shut down for a couple of hours Wednesday, July 11, because of rockfalls and mudslides caused by heavy rain.


One woman who drove through it with her two nephews — but managed to avoid damage — called it an awful, scary situation with rocks bigger than a basketball falling in front of her SUV and many vehicles getting stuck.


The highway reopened about 1:40 p.m. once the mess was cleaned up, though drivers were warned to continue to be careful because the thunderstorms haven’t ended.

A flash-flood watch is in effect in the mountains and high deserts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties through 7 p.m., while flood warnings and advisories have been issued for specific locations within those areas as immediate hazards have popped up.

A radar analysis indicates that by 3 p.m., the storm had dumped up to 2.8 inches of rain in the San Bernardino Mountains, with the heaviest rainfall just west of Big Bear Lake and north of Highway 18.


Both lanes of the 18 became blocked by rocks about 11:30 a.m., and the highway was shut down between the dam at the western end of the lake and Snow Valley.


Jessica Guyette, 30, was driving her nephews, 7-year-old Noah and 8-year-old Nick, in the Arctic Circle area between Big Bear and Running Springs when they got caught in the rockslide.


“Rocks were falling in front of my car, mud was coming down,” she said. Most ranged from the size of a baseball to the size of a basketball, and the largest rocks were the size of two or three basketballs together.


“It was scary,” she said.


In her Toyota 4Runner, Guyette — a lifelong Big Bear resident who said as bad as it was, she’s seen worse — was able to navigate around the rocks and mud, but lower-clearance vehicles around her weren’t so lucky. She said she saw lots of people stopped, and wasn’t sure if they had been damaged or got flat tires from the rocks or just didn’t want to try to get through the mud.

She told her nephews they were lucky to have made it through safely before the road closed.


Guyette posted a video to Twitter of Noah giving a warning to others: “You guys,” he says from inside the car as the rain outside can be heard, “we are up in Big Bear so you might want to be prepared with a umbrella and a — a heavy-duty jacket, because it is very, very rainy.”


Nick chimes in, “And stay in your house.”


Noah continues, “There’s a whole bunch of rocks falling down off the mountain, and a whole bunch of mud.”

Tow trucks were called to help the vehicles that weren’t as lucky as Guyette and got stuck in the closure, according to a CHP incident log.


About 10 miles south, rain was also falling, but less intensely, in the Forest Falls area where the 1,348-acre Valley fire is still burning. That area saw thunderstorms and mudslides on Saturday. On Wednesday afternoon, only a few tenths of an inch of rain had fallen in Forest Falls, according to the weather service, but heavier rain was falling to the north and south.

PUBLISHED: July 11, 2018 at 1:23 pm | UPDATED: July 11, 2018 at 8:34 pm

A 7-mile stretch of Highway 18 near Big Bear in the San Bernardino Mountains was shut down for a couple of hours Wednesday, July 11, because of rockfalls and mudslides caused by heavy rain.


One woman who drove through it with her two nephews — but managed to avoid damage — called it an awful, scary situation with rocks bigger than a basketball falling in front of her SUV and many vehicles getting stuck.


The highway reopened about 1:40 p.m. once the mess was cleaned up, though drivers were warned to continue to be careful because the thunderstorms haven’t ended.

A flash-flood watch is in effect in the mountains and high deserts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties through 7 p.m., while flood warnings and advisories have been issued for specific locations within those areas as immediate hazards have popped up.

A radar analysis indicates that by 3 p.m., the storm had dumped up to 2.8 inches of rain in the San Bernardino Mountains, with the heaviest rainfall just west of Big Bear Lake and north of Highway 18.


Both lanes of the 18 became blocked by rocks about 11:30 a.m., and the highway was shut down between the dam at the western end of the lake and Snow Valley.


Jessica Guyette, 30, was driving her nephews, 7-year-old Noah and 8-year-old Nick, in the Arctic Circle area between Big Bear and Running Springs when they got caught in the rockslide.


“Rocks were falling in front of my car, mud was coming down,” she said. Most ranged from the size of a baseball to the size of a basketball, and the largest rocks were the size of two or three basketballs together.


“It was scary,” she said.


In her Toyota 4Runner, Guyette — a lifelong Big Bear resident who said as bad as it was, she’s seen worse — was able to navigate around the rocks and mud, but lower-clearance vehicles around her weren’t so lucky. She said she saw lots of people stopped, and wasn’t sure if they had been damaged or got flat tires from the rocks or just didn’t want to try to get through the mud.

She told her nephews they were lucky to have made it through safely before the road closed.


Guyette posted a video to Twitter of Noah giving a warning to others: “You guys,” he says from inside the car as the rain outside can be heard, “we are up in Big Bear so you might want to be prepared with a umbrella and a — a heavy-duty jacket, because it is very, very rainy.”


Nick chimes in, “And stay in your house.”


Noah continues, “There’s a whole bunch of rocks falling down off the mountain, and a whole bunch of mud.”

A Fontana woman was arrested after she allegedly left her two young children — ages 1 year and 9 months — in a car in nearly 100-degree weather while she shopped at an Ontario Walmart for about half an hour, Ontario police said.


Crystal Reyna Gonzales, 34, was arrested Sunday evening on suspicion of cruelty to a child after several people, including a security officer, noticed the children inside the white SUV and called police, officials said. She has since posted $100,000 bail and was released.


Gonzales told Ontario police she is the mother of both children. Police said it’s unknown at this time if she is their biological mother.


“The AC was not on, the windows were slightly cracked, but the car was off and the doors were locked,” Ontario police Detective Melissa Ramirez said. “We estimate she was in the store for at least half an hour. Investigators are reviewing video surveillance for a more accurate time.”


Around 7:45 p.m., Curtis Owens and his family were leaving Walmart when he noticed the large white SUV was not parked correctly.


“That’s the first thing I notice,” Owens of Ontario said. “Then I hear music. The music is playing but I didn’t see anyone inside. Then my daughter says, ‘I think someone is in there.’ I look in the backseat and that’s when I see the carseat and I see the toddler.”


Shocked and panicked at seeing the child inside the hot car, Owens tried to open the doors of the vehicle but they were locked, he said. He then ran back into the store and alerted employees a child was locked inside a hot vehicle.


“At that point, I think people saw me being frantic and started gathering around the vehicle,” Owens said.


He ran back outside and began a Facebook Live recording. In the video, Owens recorded for more than 11 minutes before Gonzales appeared and was questioned by officers.


“A security guard who works at the store called 911 when the guard saw numerous people gathered around a white GMC,” Ramirez said. “When she realized there were two young children — age 1 year and 9 months — in distress due to the high temperatures she called the police.”

According to the National Weather Service, the temperature in Ontario was about 95 degrees at the time the call came in but Owens said it felt a lot hotter.


“I honestly wanted to pull those babies out and hold them until someone arrived,” he said, but waited for police and rescue personnel.

“Both children were medically evaluated at the scene but ended up not needing to be transported to a hospital,” Ramirez said. The children were handed over to Child Protective Services.


In the video, people can be heard thanking Owens for being vigilant and saving the children’s lives, but for the father and husband, he feels he did what anyone else would do.


“I don’t think it’s about being a father or mother, it’s about those children and I would like to think that anyone else in the same situation would be alert and aware and do the same thing,” he said.


The case is still under investigation.


Anyone with information about the investigation can contact Ontario Detective Steve Munoz at 909-408-1462.

“Both children were medically evaluated at the scene but ended up not needing to be transported to a hospital,” Ramirez said. The children were handed over to Child Protective Services.


In the video, people can be heard thanking Owens for being vigilant and saving the children’s lives, but for the father and husband, he feels he did what anyone else would do.


“I don’t think it’s about being a father or mother, it’s about those children and I would like to think that anyone else in the same situation would be alert and aware and do the same thing,” he said.


The case is still under investigation.


Anyone with information about the investigation can contact Ontario Detective Steve Munoz at 909-408-1462.

Poetry and photography have been combined to tell the story of the Inland Empire citrus laborer.


At 10 stations spaced along a trail meandering through the scenic groves of California Citrus State Historic Park in Riverside, black-and-white poster-sized photographs capture the faces of hard-working pickers while poetic lines of text place them in context.


The displays debuted in May 2017. They are a product of a partnership between the park and UC Riverside that seeks to tell a more complete history of the region’s storied citrus industry.


The photos were taken by photographer Thomas McGovern, a professor of art at Cal State San Bernardino, and they were superimposed over large color photos of citrus trees.

The images are paired with catchy phrases coined by poet Juan Delgado, a retired Cal State San Bernardino professor of English.


The two artists also collaborated on “Vital Signs,” an earlier award-winning book about San Bernardino.


One line in the citrus exhibit states: “He is beside you behind a curtain of quivering leaves.” It is positioned beneath the portrait of an unidentified man with a proud, weathered face who looks to be in his upper 50s.


The inspiration for that illustration and others came from a visit Delgado and McGovern paid during the orange harvest of early 2017. Although the trees are inside a state park, they are harvested commercially by local growers.


“The men were moving in and out of the trees and you could lose a person very quickly,” Delgado said. “They were very nimble and very quick. You could hear the working and the rustling. But you couldn’t see them.”


As he frequently lost sight of the pickers behind one tree or another, it occurred to Delgado that society often misses the behind-the-scenes contributions laborers have made to the wildly successful and iconic industry that has shaped much of Inland Empire history.


“It was a metaphor for the invisibility of their labor,” he said.

Delgado and McGovern hope the illustrations will begin to move the public’s appreciation for the laborer out from behind the curtain of quivering leaves.


“The idea was to show this picturesque beautiful grove and, in that, to demonstrate what it takes to get these oranges from the grove to the grocery store,” McGovern said.

Poetry and photography have been combined to tell the story of the Inland Empire citrus laborer.


At 10 stations spaced along a trail meandering through the scenic groves of California Citrus State Historic Park in Riverside, black-and-white poster-sized photographs capture the faces of hard-working pickers while poetic lines of text place them in context.


The displays debuted in May 2017. They are a product of a partnership between the park and UC Riverside that seeks to tell a more complete history of the region’s storied citrus industry.


The photos were taken by photographer Thomas McGovern, a professor of art at Cal State San Bernardino, and they were superimposed over large color photos of citrus trees.

The images are paired with catchy phrases coined by poet Juan Delgado, a retired Cal State San Bernardino professor of English.


The two artists also collaborated on “Vital Signs,” an earlier award-winning book about San Bernardino.


One line in the citrus exhibit states: “He is beside you behind a curtain of quivering leaves.” It is positioned beneath the portrait of an unidentified man with a proud, weathered face who looks to be in his upper 50s.


The inspiration for that illustration and others came from a visit Delgado and McGovern paid during the orange harvest of early 2017. Although the trees are inside a state park, they are harvested commercially by local growers.


“The men were moving in and out of the trees and you could lose a person very quickly,” Delgado said. “They were very nimble and very quick. You could hear the working and the rustling. But you couldn’t see them.”


As he frequently lost sight of the pickers behind one tree or another, it occurred to Delgado that society often misses the behind-the-scenes contributions laborers have made to the wildly successful and iconic industry that has shaped much of Inland Empire history.


“It was a metaphor for the invisibility of their labor,” he said.

Delgado and McGovern hope the illustrations will begin to move the public’s appreciation for the laborer out from behind the curtain of quivering leaves.


“The idea was to show this picturesque beautiful grove and, in that, to demonstrate what it takes to get these oranges from the grove to the grocery store,” McGovern said.

Visitors strolling through the aromatic groves at California Citrus State Historic Park in Riverside can’t help but be awestruck by the rows of verdant fruit trees that hearken back to a rich chapter in Inland Empire history.


But something is missing from the picture.


“When you look out here, you see trees, but the trees are empty of people’s voices,” said park interpreter Steve Moreno-Terrill, who was leading a tour of the 250-acre state park.


What’s missing are the faces, names and stories of thousands of workers who labored in the once-sprawling groves and packing houses, said park officials and researchers.


Citizens from diverse ethnic backgrounds and immigrants from all over the world — Chinese, Italians, Japanese, Koreans, Mexicans and others — all played a part.


“With citrus, what’s really important is that this entire region was built on the backs of the labor of so many different groups of people,” said Cathy Gudis, director of UC Riverside’s Public History program.

With that in mind, Gudis and other researchers set out to fill gaps in local history through the Relevancy and History Project, a partnership between UCR and California’s park system.


Launched in 2016, it’s an experimental program that may be replicated at other state parks with deep ties to history, Gudis said.


The goal is “to bring to life stories that have not necessarily been publicly shared because traditional archives, museums and historical societies didn’t always collect, save or present the stories of working people — that face of our population who may not have been part of the managerial elite,” she said.

In March, the project gave birth to an exhibit in the visitor-center lobby that bears the name, “Finding Ourselves in the Groves: Stories and Storytellers of Citrus in Inland Southern California.”


The display highlights the laborers in the decades following Eliza Tibbets‘ famous planting of the parent navel orange tree in Riverside in 1873.


The display also showcases the African-American settlers who shaped the industry as grove owners, arborists and investors. And it mentions the contributions of Native American youth from the Sherman Institute boarding school who worked in the fields.


By shining a spotlight on the waves of people brought to the Inland Empire to pick and pack, the exhibit doubles as a snapshot of changing U.S. immigration policy. An especially formative policy was the Bracero Program launched in 1942, at the height of World War II, which replenished the nation’s dwindling labor supply and opened the door for Mexican citizens to enter the U.S. as guest workers.


But the exhibit isn’t just about groups. It’s also about individuals.

One such individual is 72-year-old Riverside native Manuel Venegas, who spent much of his childhood working the groves. At age 5, he picked low-hanging fruit while his father and oldest brother harvested oranges or lemons higher up in the trees.


“They called us ratas — rats — because we would pick the bottom,” Venegas said in an interview.


He’d work from 7 a.m. until noon. “Of course, some of that was fooling around — chasing rabbits and things like that,” he said.


As Venegas got older, he shifted his focus from rabbits to efficiency.


“My brothers and I got so good we would quit when we got 100 boxes — each — and we would get 100 boxes by noon,” he said, adding that a box contained about 60 pounds of fruit.


Venegas still has the clippers he used to cut stems and the canvas bag that held the oranges he picked.


A 2017 portrait of Venegas graces a wall inside the visitor center entrance. His wife, Yolanda, said their grandson was overwhelmed when he first saw it. “He just thought, ‘My grandpa’s famous.’”


The exhibit also features a much older photo of his late father, Joe Venegas, and older brother, Joe Venegas Jr., provided by his family.


The picture is an example of the historical treasures the Relevancy and History Project mined from local family collections over the past two years.


On about three dozen occasions, researchers gathered people at festivals, cultural events, libraries, museums and historical society meetings in San Bernardino, Riverside, Redlands, Banning and Loma Linda to explain the project and solicit their help.


Armed with a state grant that will keep the project going through March 2019, team members said they intend to continue building upon the trove of photographs, artifacts and oral histories.


Park interpreter Megan Suster said the team emphasizes that people’s personal recollections are important parts of local history.


“That’s what we’re trying to tell people: Your stories matter,” Suster said.


As that point is driven home, Moreno-Terrill said, people’s faces light up as they enthusiastically recount their picking and packing experiences. And team members often are surprised by what they found.


“Almost everyone we met with — no matter their race — said they had to pick when they were kids,” Gudis said. “It quickly became obvious that citrus runs deep here.”

It also became obvious that women and children played key roles. And the exhibit points that out.


A “Women’s Work” display notes that packing has largely been the responsibility of females going back to the 1890s and primarily of Latinas since World War II.


Then there is a “Child’s Play” display that spotlights youngsters’ experiences and adds an element of fun to the exhibit’s serious historical portrait. One of its features is a black-and-white photo from about 1895 of boys playing in the Gage Canal, used to irrigate the groves.


“That’s where a lot of people learned how to swim,” Gudis said.


Interestingly, she added, it’s also where some learned to surf. Kids surfed the canal by having a horse run alongside the waterway and pull them on a plank of floating plywood.

Visitors strolling through the aromatic groves at California Citrus State Historic Park in Riverside can’t help but be awestruck by the rows of verdant fruit trees that hearken back to a rich chapter in Inland Empire history.


But something is missing from the picture.


“When you look out here, you see trees, but the trees are empty of people’s voices,” said park interpreter Steve Moreno-Terrill, who was leading a tour of the 250-acre state park.


What’s missing are the faces, names and stories of thousands of workers who labored in the once-sprawling groves and packing houses, said park officials and researchers.


Citizens from diverse ethnic backgrounds and immigrants from all over the world — Chinese, Italians, Japanese, Koreans, Mexicans and others — all played a part.


“With citrus, what’s really important is that this entire region was built on the backs of the labor of so many different groups of people,” said Cathy Gudis, director of UC Riverside’s Public History program.

An especially formative policy was the Bracero Program launched in 1942, at the height of World War II, which replenished the nation’s dwindling labor supply and opened the door for Mexican citizens to enter the U.S. as guest workers.


But the exhibit isn’t just about groups. It’s also about individuals.

One such individual is 72-year-old Riverside native Manuel Venegas, who spent much of his childhood working the groves. At age 5, he picked low-hanging fruit while his father and oldest brother harvested oranges or lemons higher up in the trees.


“They called us ratas — rats — because we would pick the bottom,” Venegas said in an interview.


He’d work from 7 a.m. until noon. “Of course, some of that was fooling around — chasing rabbits and things like that,” he said.


As Venegas got older, he shifted his focus from rabbits to efficiency.


“My brothers and I got so good we would quit when we got 100 boxes — each — and we would get 100 boxes by noon,” he said, adding that a box contained about 60 pounds of fruit.


Venegas still has the clippers he used to cut stems and the canvas bag that held the oranges he picked.


A 2017 portrait of Venegas graces a wall inside the visitor center entrance. His wife, Yolanda, said their grandson was overwhelmed when he first saw it. “He just thought, ‘My grandpa’s famous.’”


The exhibit also features a much older photo of his late father, Joe Venegas, and older brother, Joe Venegas Jr., provided by his family.


The picture is an example of the historical treasures the Relevancy and History Project mined from local family collections over the past two years.


On about three dozen occasions, researchers gathered people at festivals, cultural events, libraries, museums and historical society meetings in San Bernardino, Riverside, Redlands, Banning and Loma Linda to explain the project and solicit their help.


Armed with a state grant that will keep the project going through March 2019, team members said they intend to continue building upon the trove of photographs, artifacts and oral histories.


Park interpreter Megan Suster said the team emphasizes that people’s personal recollections are important parts of local history.


“That’s what we’re trying to tell people: Your stories matter,” Suster said.


As that point is driven home, Moreno-Terrill said, people’s faces light up as they enthusiastically recount their picking and packing experiences. And team members often are surprised by what they found.


“Almost everyone we met with — no matter their race — said they had to pick when they were kids,” Gudis said. “It quickly became obvious that citrus runs deep here.”

It also became obvious that women and children played key roles. And the exhibit points that out.


A “Women’s Work” display notes that packing has largely been the responsibility of females going back to the 1890s and primarily of Latinas since World War II.


Then there is a “Child’s Play” display that spotlights youngsters’ experiences and adds an element of fun to the exhibit’s serious historical portrait. One of its features is a black-and-white photo from about 1895 of boys playing in the Gage Canal, used to irrigate the groves.


“That’s where a lot of people learned how to swim,” Gudis said.


Interestingly, she added, it’s also where some learned to surf. Kids surfed the canal by having a horse run alongside the waterway and pull them on a plank of floating plywood.

PUBLISHED: July 11, 2018 at 5:20 pm | UPDATED: July 12, 2018 at 5:48 pm

The Hollywood sign is marking its 95th year and is one of the most popular landmarks in the world. Recently, Warner Bros. offered to build a $100 million tram to allow people to see it up close.


Here’s how the sign has changed and more about that tram.


Possible tram


This week Warner Bros. disclosed that it is considering fully financing a $100 million aerial tram from its lot in Burbank to the Hollywood sign in Griffith Park. Here’s how that might affect the area:


Residents near the sign have had to deal with traffic congestion around Griffith Park, so in January, transportation consulting firm Dixon Resources Unlimited released a comprehensive report on possible solutions. One included creating an aerial tram, while other plans included constructing a second Hollywood sign on the other side of the mountain or developing a shuttle service up Beachwood Canyon.


The Los Angeles City Council said it would assess the report and determine if any of the solutions were feasible.

How the sign has changed


The Hollywood sign was dedicated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1973. It hasn’t always been appreciated as it is today. And, like many things in Hollywood, the sign has undergone a few facelifts.


Taking care of a landmark


The sign has undergone several renovations since it was built in 1923. The land and sign were sold to Los Angeles in the mid-1940s, and the Department of Parks and Recreation rebuilt the sign in 1949 and removed the “land” letters.

Alice Cooper buys a vowel


The biggest renovation came in 1978 after several celebrities, including Playboy Magazine owner Hugh Hefner, raised funds to rebuild it. The letters were auctioned off for $27,500 apiece ($104,828 in 2018 dollars).


The nine donors for the sign by letter:


Since 1992, The Hollywood Sign Trust, a nonprofit organization, has been in charge of maintaining and securing the sign.


Neighbor trams?


Warner Bros. isn’t the only one thinking about aerial trams in L.A.


This year, a company submitted plans to the city of Los Angeles for an aerial tram that would link Union Station to Dodger Stadium.


Aerial Rapid Transit Technologies hopes to have the tram operating in 2022.

The handcrafted models look so realistic it’s easy to visualize them leaving San Bernardino Army Air Field in 1950.


On Thursday, June 21, the Norton Air Force Base Museum unveiled a special exhibit commemorating the 196th Fighter Squadron, which was assigned at the East Third Street base from September 1946 to October 1950, before the base’s name change.


The custom display features five pint-sized replicas of war-era aircraft and a historical narrative of the first active flying unit to be based at Norton after World War II.


The squadron “is one of the building blocks of when the military first came to San Bernardino after the war,” said Bob Edwards, museum president. The activity around the base at that time, he added, “was a great shot in the arm for San Bernardino.


“It impacted schools, hospitals, the commercial sector. The community was very supportive of the base and what it represented.”

A couple of years ago, Ernest Garcia, an enlisted airman in the 196th Fighter Squadron, visited the Norton museum and noticed there was no mention of his squad.


He met with Edwards, and later spoke to his former boss Glenn A. Woodfin, one of the squadron’s first six members. Woodfin then connected with Lt. Col. Norman K. Edwards (Ret.), a base operations officer of the group the 196th evolved into.


The two laid out an exhibit.


The historical narrative details the 196th’s 1946 formation and subsequent years in San Bernardino. The squadron was activated in 1950 during the Korean conflict and moved to George Air Force Base in Victorville for deployment to Japan.


The unit returned to Ontario International Airport in 1952 as the 8,196th Fighter Squadron. The unit now is at March Air Force Base in Riverside.


Tom Butz, a professional model maker, crafted the highly detailed model aircraft – inside clear display cases are 12- to 14-inch replicas of the P-51D, T-6 Texan, C-47 Dakota, F-80C and B-26C assigned to the then-San Bernardino Army Air Field.


At Thursday’s ceremony, Garcia and NASA astronaut Vance Brand, a former 196th pilot, were among the guest speakers to share memories of their time at the base.


“The museum is the best depository of the history of Norton Air Force Base and what it meant to the city of San Bernardino and the Inland Empire,” Bob Edwards said. “Our mission statement is to preserve, honor and promote the history of Norton Air Force Base and capture where all these items came from.”


The museum, at 1601 E. Third St., is open 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thursdays and Saturdays.


UPDATE: This story has been updated to include the museum’s hours of operation.

About a year ago I started to receive the Sun newspaper and I was always having issues with my delivery. So I cancelled my account. I have moved live in a nicer neighborhood and my girlfriend decided ...she wanted to get the paper Sunday through Thursday only. So three months ago I signed up for the paper. Since then every week I've had to call 3 times a week because we've only received our Sunday paper and not the Thursday, Friday or Saturday paper. I don't know what the issue is. Every time I called to give me a different excuse why we did not receive it. So today after speaking to an area supervisor I am giving them one more week. If I do not receive this week's papers I will be canceling my subscription and asking for a full refund. See More

We signed up in March and have yet to have a full week of delivery. We have not gotten a paper since June 1 - with the exception of the Sunday paper. We call and they tell us they will have one out ...- it never shows up. We ask to speak to a delivery manager and are told we can't because they do not have a local manager. We ask for a refund and are told it is not their policy. So we are paying for the newspaper and not receiving it. How is that different than theft and/or fraud? See More

Letter to the San Bernardino Sun 5-17-18

Our local papers are just NY Times clones. A more expensive version of the National Enquirer. I was doing some research trying to find the name of a past BIA ...president and came across a Sun article on it's website. The article was faded out with an invitation to ""subscribe"". In other words it was the media version of pay-per-view. Screw that crap.

My new ""morning paper"" is FrontPage Magazine. Along with the Gatestone Institute, Jihad Watch and the Middle East Quarterly, among others.

Why would I PAY to have smoke blown up my ass from what is essentially a leftist rag? Yeah; and this ""article"" was about ""social justice"" in the building industry:

“Study Adds Social-Justice Dimension To Housing Crisis By The (San Bernardino Sun) Editorial Board”.

This sick twisted, fascist PC, multicultural BS that has already helped destroy our schools and colleges (And has brought Europe to the brink of collapse), are infesting every other part of our lives in corporations and government. Quality and merit count for nothing in this liberal fascist world and the Sun regurgitates the Party Line up to and including the mandatory bashing of president Trump.

The target audience of the NY Times/SBdo Sun are those people too stupid and too lazy to really study the issues. You know who I'm talking about. When you post a well reasoned opinion from a conservative point of view their response is always adolescent name calling like accusing you of being a ""Trumpanzee"" or some such crap. Even if the topic has absolutely nothing to do with Trump!

These are the idiots who never respond like this Lee Fang who recently joined with NBC ""News"" in bashing and slandering the Gatestone Institute. I challenged him on his rag's Fakebook page, The Intercept, and so far have not gotten a response. Although I am surprised that they haven't blocked me outright....yet. Like they have on the Riverside Police Department and City of Riverside's Fakebook pages. Yeah; and even my congressman, I forget his name, blocked me on his Fakebook page for telling the truth about his beloved ""Islam"".

So it looks like I'm not able to go read any article in the Sun about that school who put a two page article about Muslims in their Rancho Cucamonga high school yearbook ""ALLAH AKBAR"" is the title, believe it or not. Of course, as one student pointed out, there's no mention of Judaism or Christianity. And saying anything about it would be ""racist"" or ""Islamophobic"". The kind of garbage these Sun ""reporters"" buy into and regurgitate when they trot out the terrorist front group CAIR after every ISLAMIC terrorist attack.

And on and on and on and.......

I lived in Fontana for 20 years no major issues with my paper, i lived in Colton for 2 years same, I live in highland and didn't receive my paper for 3 months not one paper Sept-Dec. I let it expire w...as not going to renew it. So when they called me and told me things have been corrected and I would receive my paper on Sunday 1-14-18 I thinking I would love my paper again here it is Monday and I still haven't gotten it. I can't believe how you're distribution has gotten. I have spoken to mangers in different departments and no help. See More

I stopped reviving it at home because I couldn't get it delivered to my door.
I can't even buy one before 5:30am at the local gas stations and I don't see news paper boxes anymore.

Paper is not here... again. Production issues they say and it should be delivered by 9 AM.... Well that time has come and gone and still NO Paper by 11:30! This happens about once a week that it is no...t delivered for one reason or another. The automated ""customer service"" tells me I should speak to a representative and to do so I will need to call back tomorrow. Today, being Thanksgiving, we were looking forward to seeing the Black Friday advertisements. I think their production manager needs to be reevaluated and perhaps replaced. Thier customer service is non-existent. It has been automated and is impersonal. Very upsetting! #SunFail See More

The paper is never delivered and when we call the customer service individual has an attitude. So we just canceled it for good.

I am disappointed in the Sun recently. There is not much news and very little concerning San Bernardino. The paper is late 1 or more days a week. When I call for a missed paper they take several hours.... They use to knock on the door and give me my paper. Now they just toss it in the driveway and I go out every 15 minutes. No customer service anymore. I would change papers but I would have to go to the LA Times. I may just quit altogether. See More

Isn’t social media free? Why are you charging us to view the articles?
Walker Haus

The San Bernardino Sun which also includes the Press Enterprise has got to be one of the worst actual paper or online news papers I have ever seen. To whoever it is that is in charge, I have a couple ...of questions.

1) Do you even take the time to read any of the fecal matter printed in your own news publication?

2) If yes, How do you allow this type of journalistic crap to continue?

If I had submitted an article of this lack of journalistic quality to my high school journalism instructor like the ones I continually see in this news publication, I would've received an ""F"" grade.

So I what I want to know, is it the writers' fault or the fault of the lead editor or a mix of both? I say both. The editing is as bad as the writing and can be considered worse because the editors continue to allow this type of fecal matter to go to print unchecked.

Article after horrible article creatively (gag) titled ""Why this"" ""Why that"" and ""Here's Why"" ""Here's what"" ""Here's who"" Here's how"" or ""Here's where"" lack creativity and seldom if ever, even tell the who, what, why, where or how. What makes it worse is that you actually try to make people pay for this crap. I believe that the readers not only want better quality in a local news paper, we expect it. I want to see an article entitled ""Here's How And When The Inland Empire Readers Can Expect To See A Better News Paper."" The only problem is that I have serious doubts that the current staff is capable of making that happen. See More

It’s the only shitty online newspaper trying to make people pay to read an article

Garbage. What happened to editing? Do people not read what is being published? So many simple grammar errors and mistakes. In the following segment, Danny is identified as the person being stabbed. B...y the end of the article Dominguez has stab wounds and is the one who died...

You can pay me a dollar less than the current editor and I'll work for you. Don't worry, you can keep me in your pocket SBSUN.

""Manuel 'Tommy' Dominguez had been accused by his cousin Danny Chagolla, 32, of stealing his phone,"" said Eileen Hards, spokeswoman for the San Bernardino Police Department. ""He and Danny began to fight in the street and Danny was stabbed. No one but Danny was around the victim when he was stabbed.""

Police received a 911 call reporting a stabbing at 1111 N. Lugo Ave., she said. Officers found Dominguez, inside the home with what appeared to stab wounds to the upper back area. See More

Anyone who hasn’t been to Anaheim’s Downtown Disney recently may be startled by the sweeping changes they’ll find, including shuttered restaurants and businesses that make the west end of the district resemble a failed mall.


The closures are only temporary, though, as the closed businesses along the western edge of the retail and dining district, including the Rainforest Cafe, ESPN Zone, Earl of Sandwich and the AMC Theatres will eventually be hidden by construction walls and then demolished to make way for a posh new hotel slated to open in 2021. It will be built on 17 acres comprising the west side of the outdoor mall to the border of the existing Disneyland Hotel.


Other buildings are also vacant, as they are being remodeled to make way for new venues. In the mall’s center, the shuttered building that formerly contained the Build-a-Bear and RideMakerz shops is undergoing renovations from kid-friendly shops into new dining-and-drinking spots emphasizing craft beer including Ballast Point, a microbrewery out of San Diego and Black Tap Craft Burgers & Beer.


This is the first comprehensive overhaul of the property since it opened in January 2001. Downtown Disney originally developed as part of a massive project that included the creation of Disney California Adventure theme park from the former Disneyland parking lot and one of the largest parking garages in the nation. The district was designed to link Disney California Adventure with the existing Disneyland and capture extra tourist dollars on site, rather than letting them slip away to other businesses along Harbor Boulevard.


When it first opened, the district was also popular with locals looking for Disney-themed shopping, dining, seeing a movie at the AMC Theatres and maybe even watching the Disneyland fireworks from outside the park.


But the parking lot set aside specifically for Downtown Disney visitors became so overcrowded that parking validation policies were tightened, making it costly for locals to use the space as an outdoor mall without spending money. Nowadays, many users believe that Disney officials want to court out-of-town visitors who will open their wallets wider, catering to them with the new hotel and other businesses that serve travelers.


“It seems like they’re trying to get more dollars spent per head as opposed to people like me, who will just walk around and buy a churro and eat occasionally,” Disney fan and annual passholder Roger Yamashita said. “I’ve been to every Disney park in the world and it seems like they are trying to adopt more of a Walt Disney World model, to make it for a vacation destination.”


In the past, Yamashita, who lives in Yorba Linda, said he and his friends would drop by after work or on a Sunday afternoon to enjoy the frequent live music, go to ESPN Zone or eat at Naples Ristorante. “I imagine I’ll still be going, but not as often.”


Yamashita cited the closure of the most affordable restaurant at Downtown Disney – the popular Earl of Sandwich – as another way that locals will be discouraged from visiting the district.


Locals who patronized the former House of Blues music venue have also moved over to the nearby Anaheim GardenWalk mall, since it was replaced by bowling-drinking-and-dining venue Splitsville.


Disneyland spokeswoman Liz Jaeger declined to discuss any particular plan behind the renovations, except to say that the many changes will result in “a fresh, one-of-a-kind Disney experience, providing guests of all ages a mix of family-friendly dining, shopping and entertainment.”


Soon, people seeking to park their cars at the Downtown Disney will be diverted to a new location, while heavy equipment will move in to begin construction of the new 700-room hotel, expected to open in 2021. Its ground floor will house restaurants and shops, and Disney fans are hoping places like the Earl of Sandwich will relocate there. For now, though, parking and security entrances will remain the same at least until some time in August.


The as-yet-unnamed hotel will cater to upscale guests and will feature the chance to board the monorail inside the structure. Disneyland Resort currently has three hotel properties in Anaheim: The Disneyland Hotel, Disney’s Grand Californian and Disney’s Paradise Pier. A master plan shows how they would all be linked after the area is redeveloped.

Disney’s plans for the hotel are still being reviewed by the city of Anaheim and likely to go before the Planning Commission for approval later this summer, city spokeswoman Lauren Gold said. Until it’s approved, no specific timeline has been made public for construction to begin.


“Over the next several months, several fresh dining concepts include Ballast Point, Black Tap Craft Burgers & Shakes and Salt & Straw, will open at Downtown Disney District, which will give the destination a new robust blend of eateries,” Disney’s Jaeger said in a prepared statement. “Recent additions such as The VOID, Splitsville Luxury Lanes and Disney Home are already giving our guests new ways to experience the Disneyland Resort.”

The women who spoke out against the abuse by Larry Nassar stood together Wednesday night in a powerful and solemn closing to the show highlighting the past year’s top athletes and moments in sports.


Gymnast Aly Raisman, softball player Tiffany Thomas Lopez and gymnast Sarah Klein, who said she was Nassar’s first victim 30 years ago, took turns speaking. Klein chided the U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State for placing “money and medals above the safety of child athletes.”


Olympic snowboarding champion Chloe Kim won a leading three ESPYs, including best female athlete, while Alex Ovechkin claimed best male athlete.


Kim had tears in her eyes as she listened to the Arthur Ashe recipients.


“We must start caring about children’s safety more than we care about adults’ reputations,” Klein said. “If we can just give one person the courage to use their voice, this is worth it.”


Raisman added, “For too long we were ignored. It could have been avoided. All we needed was one adult to have the integrity to stand between us and Larry Nassar.”


“To all the survivors out there, don't let anyone rewrite your story. Your truth does matter. You matter. And you are not alone.”

The audience gave the group a prolonged standing ovation and remained on its feet while the women spoke.


“What a powerful stage up here,” host Danica Patrick said before signing off.


Ovechkin joined Roger Federer and Olympic snowboarder Shaun White as double winners. Ovechkin was in Russia with his wife, Nastya, who is 8½ months pregnant.Newly retired racecar driver Patrick became the first woman to host the show at the Microsoft Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Her opening monologue mostly fell flat, with athletes sitting stone-faced or wincing at many of the jokes.


Kim took female athlete honors over Olympic skier Mikaela Shiffrin, WNBA player Sylvia Fowles and soccer player Julie Ertz.


“This year has been filled with so many incredible memories I will hold onto the rest of my life,” Kim said as she held the silver trophy. “I really want to thank my family. They’ve sacrificed so much for me.”


Kim also claimed trophies for best female Olympian and female action sports athlete. At the Pyeongchang Games in February, she became the youngest to win a snowboarding medal when the then-17-year-old claimed gold in halfpipe.


Ovechkin, who led the Washington Capitals to their first Stanley Cup championship, also won for best NHL player. He beat out Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and fellow first-time nominees Jose Altuve of the Houston Astros and James Harden of the Houston Rockets for male athlete.


Federer’s five-set victory at the Australian Open in January for his 20th Grand Slam singles title earned honors for record-breaking performance and he also received best male tennis player.


White won best Olympic moment with his final-run performance in South Korea featuring back-to-back 1440s to take gold, and best male Olympian.


The Astros were honored as best team for winning the franchise’s first World Series.


LeBron James, soon to be starring across the street at Staples Center with the Los Angeles Lakers, won best NBA player for the third straight year on his 14th consecutive nomination in the category.


Brady claimed best NFL player, while Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels won MLB player.

The Minnesota Vikings earned best moment honors for beating the New Orleans Saints on the last play of the NFL championship game.


Notre Dame’s Arike Ogunbowale won in the best play category for hitting a buzzer-beater in the NCAA women’s title game.


The best coach award was given posthumously to Aaron Feis, Scott Beigel and Chris Hixon, all of whom died in the mass shooting at Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.


Former quarterback Jim Kelly received the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance for his struggle with jaw cancer. Fellow NFL Hall of Famers Dan Marino and John Elway presented Kelly with the honor.

Let’s politely say the conclusions varied.


So who’s correct? Who do you trust? Retirement choices are no small matter.


Let me take a literal middle ground by considering their collective wisdom. As a public service, my trusty spreadsheet helped me combine this trio of retirement location rankings to give a better picture of the varying strengths vs. weaknesses of the states.


I reassembled their published ranking data — overall scores, subindex grades and related data — into three evenly weighted metrics: costs (buying power); character (culture and climate); and care (healthcare and healthiness). What did I learn?


Florida is the place to retire, statistically speaking to my composite index. It ranked No. 1 for costs and character. But if you don’t care for humidity, and enjoy winter’s chill, No. 2 was South Dakota, which enjoyed No. 4 grades for costs and care.


Third-ranked was New Hampshire (No. 4 for character; 10th-best for care), then Virginia: (ninth-best for character) and Hawaii (No. 40 for costs but No. 1 for care!)


Conversely, don’t think about Louisiana for your golden years, according to my math. It ranked last in my reassembled scorecard. Why? No. 49 for character and No. 50 for care.


Next worst score was Arkansas (No. 47 for character), then came Kentucky (No. 47 for care); New Mexico (No. 46 for character) and Illinois (No. 41 for care).


What about California? By my math, the Golden State ranked a middle-of-the-pack 26th for one’s golden years. California’s seventh-worst ranking for costs was improved by a No. 16 grade for character and No. 18 for care.


Here is how the 50 states ranked as retirement options in order of my overall scoring then broken down by ranking for cost, character and care quality.

In year’s past it’s been a limited edition Funko Pop, a special print from that one show or an enamel pin. This year, the thing that many people were itching to take home with them wasn’t on the convention center floor but in the bathrooms.

Con-goers making a quite pit stop were pleasantly surprised by toilet seat covers emblazoned with the face of Deadpool and the message, “This is all Fox could afford. Deadpool 2 dropping soon on Blu-ray and digital.”


The seat covers were so popular, fans could be seen grabbing them by the handful and stuffing them into their complimentary SDCC bags.


One convention center worker said she’d been replacing the protective tissue paper much more frequently than years past.


Photos of the covers began to show up on social media celebrating Fox’s ingenious marketing ploy.

As with most Comic-Con exclusives, this one ended up on eBay only hours after the convention floor opened on the Wednesday, July 18, for Preview Night.


One enterpeneur wanted $60, plus shipping and handling, for a cover signed by Deadpool co-creator, Rob Liefeld. Most however ran on average for about $15 to $20 a pop.


I’m deluged with this!! Signing these left and right on the street corner!!! https://t.co/WqR9jFM87N

It’s unclear if the San Diego Convention Center was provided with enough seat covers to last the length of SDCC, but some women coming out of one of the bathrooms on preview night commented many of the stalls were without the coveted covers.


The first night of Comic-Con will officially kick off Thursday, July 19, and will run until Sunday, July 22.

Riverside County Department of Animal Services spokesman John Welsh said the feral donkey was wounded over the weekend, and a concerned resident posted images of the animal to social media, catching the attention of authorities.


Welsh described the attack on the burro as a “terrible act of cruelty” that left the animal in need of veterinary care.


The burro was spotted in the Reche Canyon area, in the vicinity of the Black Stallion Ranch, north of Moreno Valley, and animal control officers went to the location Wednesday afternoon, Welsh said.


“We shot it with two tranquilizer darts, but efforts to capture the wild burro were unsuccessful,” Welsh said. “The darts should have been enough, and we are uncertain why they were not effective.


“It could have been a result of the animal being worked up earlier, prior to our arrival,” he said.


The arrow was no longer protruding from the creature when the darts were injected, but the wound was still visible, according to Welsh


Officers will return to the area Thursday morning to have another go at corralling the burro.


Welsh said the nonprofit DonkeyLand rescue organization has been alerted and will be enlisted to assist.


Officials asked anyone with information regarding who might have injured the donkey to contact the Department of Animal Services at (951) 358-7387.


Herds of wild burros populate the Pigeon Pass and Reche Canyon areas between Moreno Valley and Colton. Riverside County Ordinance No. 934 makes it unlawful to feed, pet or otherwise draw the donkeys toward roadsides and other locations where they might be hurt — or wander into traffic and cause accidents.

The two-bedroom, three-bathroom house in the 11200 block of Dilling Street, adjacent to the Los Angeles River, is listed for $1.885 million, according to Ernie Carswell, a Douglas Elliman agent who is listing what he said “is reportedly the second most photographed home in the United States after the White House.”


The home’s interior does not match what was shown in the 1969-74 ABC series because those scenes were filmed at Paramount Studios, Carswell told the Los Angeles Times.


Several homes in the neighborhood have been demolished recently. The owners will give first consideration to bidders who want to keep the home intact, Carswell told The Times.


“We’re not going to accept the first big offer from a developer who wants to tear it down,” Carswell told The Times. “We’re going to wait a few days, in case there are others who want to purchase it as an investment to preserve it.”

Bracken Blucher pleaded guilty in May to manufacturing illegal drugs, causing a fire that resulted in property damage and a sentence-enhancing allegation of causing damage to multiple structures in a fire.


A home in the 33000 block of East Harvest Way in Wildomar was destroyed early Wednesday, July 19, 2017, in an explosion and fire that also sent one person to the hospital and damaged a neighboring house. Sheriff’s officials were investigating whether an illegal drug lab producing “honey oil” was to blame. (Photo by Frank Bellino, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG)

A Riverside County Superior Court judge certified the plea terms and imposed the sentence recommended by the Department of Probation.


The judge additionally ordered Blucher to pay victim restitution in an amount that will be determined by the agency.


Blucher was in the process of making a marijuana derivative known as “honey oil” in the predawn hours of July 19, 2017, when his residence erupted in flames from a butane gas explosion.


The blaze on Harvest Way, near Cornstalk Road, was reported at 4 a.m.


According to county fire officials, a 1,200-square foot modular home was consumed by the conflagration, and a neighboring single-story residence was moderately damaged.


Blucher suffered minor to moderate burns that required emergency treatment.


Investigators found butane gas cannisters scattered throughout the street and yard fronting the property where the fire started.

Seven engine crews and a truck company, numbering about 30 personnel, spent nearly an hour battling the flames before they were fully contained.


Three people living in the modular home with Blucher were displaced. Three adults and a child from the neighboring property required temporary lodgings.


Ironically, the blaze occurred one day after the District Attorney’s Office released a series of public service announcements warning of the perils of butane honey oil production.


The videos featured Alex Gonzales and his girlfriend Selina Cervantes, both of whom were severely burned in a butane honey oil blaze at a Palm Springs motel in February 2015. Cervantes suffered second- and third-degree burns to 97 percent of her body and was permanently disfigured.


“People need to understand that the butane honey oil extraction process takes lives — it hurts people forever,” District Attorney Mike Hestrin said before unveiling the public service announcements. “We want to put an end to the manufacture of butane honey oil.”Drug lab operators use butane to extract tincture from cannabis plants. The product, often referred to as “wax” or hash, can be mixed with anything and bottled.


Butane honey oil labs have sprung up in both remote and heavily populated areas of the county. In the past few years, butane honey oil fires have erupted in Cathedral City, Moreno Valley, Murrieta, Norco and Riverside.

Spokeswoman Amy Phillips at Fort Hunter Liggett says the wind from the rotors of a helicopter that was landing blew over the tent about 9:30 p.m. Wednesday.


Phillips says there were 22 injuries, most of them minor. She says four people were taken to hospitals. Earlier reports said up to 30 people were injured.


Fort Hunter Liggett is in Monterey County, about 170 miles south of San Francisco. The sprawling base is the largest U.S. Army Reserve Command post.


It’s currently holding an annual training exercise for thousands of Army, Navy, Air Force, Army National Guard, Army Reserve and Canadian Armed Forces troops.

About Southern California News Group


Groundbreaking


Established in March 2016, the Southern California News Group (SCNG) has virtually overnight become one of the most powerful and influential news organizations in the U.S. This dynamic union was created when the Los Angeles News Group (owners of nine local daily newspapers and websites) and its parent company Digital First Media (DFM) acquired Freedom Communications (owners of the Orange County Register and Riverside Press-Enterprise).


By combining these two highly regarded and well-established institutions, SCNG has emerged as the largest news content provider in the five-county Los Angeles metropolitan area. As a leader in circulation among top publications nationwide, SCNG now owns and operates 11 local daily newspapers and more than a dozen community weeklies.


Our mission is to connect communities by providing readers with the area's best local news coverage, while providing advertisers with unprecedented access to one of the world's most diverse and dynamic audiences.


No matter the distribution vehicle—newspaper, magazine, mobile, online—SCNG's in-depth reporting on local news, politics, sports and entertainment continues to attract a desirable audience for its customers. Combining print, online and social media, SCNG now delivers premium content to over 8.1 million adults every week, making it an indispensable marketing solution for advertisers across Southern California.

WHAT TO SEND?

  * Local stories — people, places and events — that are unique to San Bernardino County.
  * Club news about meetings, activities, special events and election of officers sponsored by civic, service, fraternal and social organizations.
  * Business news of new enterprises in town, promotions, news employees, changes in hours, services and products.
  * Church news and news of related organizations.
  * School news of student activities, parent-teacher group meetings, school concerts, plays and other events like college honors, graduations, athletics and plays.
  * Sports news about games, team registrations, tournaments and other activities.
  * Programs at parks and libraries, along with other facilities available to the public.
  * Entertainment venues, special events, family activities and other amusements.

WRITING A NEWS RELEASE

  * All news releases should contain the organization’s name and address, along with the name and daytime phone number of the individual to be contacted in case more information is needed.
  * Consider sending an electronic press release via email. Paste the text into the message field rather than sending an attachment that may not be compatible with the programs in use at the San Bernardino Sun.
  * Be concise. News releases, as a rule, should not be longer than 1½ pages, double-spaced.
  * Be aware of submission deadlines. Most publications like material at least two weeks before the event. It can never get there too early.

PHOTO


Do you have photos from a community event? Or is there an upcoming event you’d like to see covered visually? Send the details our way. For event coverage, let us know at least two weeks in advance and keep in mind we’re looking for photo opportunities that are not set up just for us. Action is the key.

We encourage coaches to send us varsity game results only. Deadline for the high school game results is 10:30 p.m. on the day of the event, but earlier calls are appreciated. E-mail sports@inlandnewspapers.com, or call 909-483-9368 or 909-483-9362 to report scores.

HOW TO SUBMIT A GUEST COMMENTARY


Los Angeles News Group newspapers consider guest commentary submissions of no more than 600 words.


We look for topical commentary on public policy and social issues that are of general interest to our print and digital readership. We give preference to local, regional and California topics and writers.


The commentary must be the author’s original work. We do not pay for guest commentaries.


Submissions are subject to editing, though we make every effort to retain the author’s voice and point of view. Email your submission to opinion@langnews.com with the subject line “Op-ed submission.” Include a sentence or two at the end including your position, city or community of residence, and any background relevant to your expertise in the topic.


HOW TO SUBMIT A LETTER TO THE EDITOR


We welcome letters to the editor on all issues of public concern. All submissions are subject to editing and condensation, and they can be published only with the writer’s true name. Letters must include the writer’s home community and a daytime phone number for confirmation. Please limit submissions to 150 words and send via email (without attachments) to opinions@inlandnewspapers.com.

Privacy Policy


Privacy Policy


PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES PERIODICALLY AND IS EFFECTIVE AS OF MAY 25, 2018.


Digital First Media (“Digital First Media,” “us,” or “we”) is committed to protecting your personal privacy. We provide this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to explain the type of Personal Information (as defined below) we collect on web sites including SMS/Text Alerts and Mobile Web owned by the Digital First Media, such as www.digitalfirstmedia.com (each, a “Web Site”), and our mobile application (the “Application,” together with Web Site, the “Platform”) and how we use Personal Information. As we update and expand our Platform and services, our Policy may change so check back to this page from time to time.


Our Policy applies to Personal Information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, through our Platform, or in other ways such as by phone, by mail, or through other offline and print media. This Policy does not apply to Personal Information collected about you by anyone except us and only applies to the Platform or Web Site to which this Policy is linked.


Types of Information We Collect


In order to make your visits to our Platform and use of the services available on or through our Platform as worthwhile as possible, we may ask you for Personal Information. “Personal Information” is information that allows someone to identify or contact you. We also may collect certain information from your computer each time you visit us that is not Personal Information. For example, non-user specific aggregated data such as information about traffic patterns on the Web Sites.


What Information is Collected on Our Platform


Information You Provide. We collect Personal Information when you provide it to us on our Platform. Such Personal Information may be collected, for example, when you submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on our Platform, send us an e-mail, sign up for an email newsletter or mobile alerts, or in any other way submit information to us via our Platform.


You may be able to send products, services, or information to others through our Platform by clicking on an “E-mail to Friend” or similar button on our Platform or in an e-mail that we have sent you. In some of these cases (unless you simply forward our e-mail on your own), you may provide the name and e-mail address of your friend or family member to us. Such Personal Information will be treated in accordance with our Policy and applicable law.


Cookies. We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser when you visit a site that are stored on your device. Cookies improve and personalize your experience on our Web Sites. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our Policy. Some web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Refusing a cookie may negatively impact the display or function of the Web Site. Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you not be “tracked” online. At this time, Digital First Media does not modify your experience based upon whether such a signal is broadcast.


Clear GIFs. We may use clear GIFs (a/k/a “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies on our Web Site and in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a Web Page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message.


Network and Internet Information. Our server may automatically collect data about your server’s internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol Address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your internet service provider whenever you’re on the internet. We may also collect the referring page that linked you to us or the next site you visit; how you use or interact with our Web Site; technical information and specifications about your browser, device, software and settings; any search terms you have entered on our Web Site or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers.


How is Information Used


We use both Personal Information and non-personal information for multiple purposes, including:

  * Improving or customizing the Web Site;
  * Providing updates;
  * Sending newsletters, promotional offers or opportunities regarding new services, products or events, and third-party products or services, including advertisements;
  * Responding to your requests including providing you with our product and service offerings;
  * Internal record keeping;
  * Reporting Personal Information about your account to credit bureaus (such as late or payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report);
  * Communicating with you about, and administering your participation in, promotions, surveys and market research;
  * Operating, evaluating, and improving our business;
  * Diagnosing problems with our Platform, administering our Platform, and enhancing the Platform;

  * Improving and analyzing our products and services;
  * Managing our communications; and

For more information about the privacy practices those social networking sites, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these social networking sites.

In addition, we also do not manage the unsubscribe process for various third party entities and Digital First Media affiliates. You should contact the respective Digital First Media affiliate or the third party entity for more information relating to their unsubscribe process or correction or removal of your Personal information.

Disclosures Without Your Consent. We may disclose Personal Information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws.

Your Rights


Objection and Opt-Out. Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to “opt-out” or object to certain of our uses of your Personal Information at any point.

You may also opt-out of promotional e-mails by clicking on an opt-out link within the e-mail you received. In some cases, we may no longer be able to provide you services if you opt-out of certain necessary processing.

Protecting Information


No transmission of data over the internet or electronic storage of data is completely secure. Digital First Media takes reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal Information provided to this Platform, but we cannot guarantee that Personal Information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.


In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information may have been compromised, we may notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and we may notify you by any method permitted by law.

Third Party “Linked-To” Web Sites

Applicant and Employee Information


If you submit an application for employment to or are currently an employee of Digital First Media, Digital First Media collects your Personal Information through your application for employment or during continued employment with Digital First Media, and your submission of employee related documents (collectively “Employee Information”). Examples of Employee Information that may be collected in connection with your employment or application for employment include your name, date of birth, government issued identification, banking information, marital status, health information, benefit information, employment history, education, job qualifications, and other relevant employee personal data. We also collect some of this information about your dependents when you provide it to us when you enroll in health and other benefits or provide contact information. By providing Personal Information about family members or other individuals, you represent that you have their consent to provide this information to us for the purposes set forth in this Policy. Employee Information does not include any Personal Information that is available to the general public and excludes information generally available on a business card.


In accordance with applicable law, Digital First Media may use Employee Information to evaluate applications for employment, manage work-related aspects of the employee-employer relationship (i.e., training, payroll, benefits, travel, reimbursement expenses, performance appraisals, succession planning, team member health and safety), investigate and respond to any claims related to your employment, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Your Employee Information will not be used for direct marketing purposes by us or any third party service provider, unless you specifically consent to such use.


Digital First Media shares your Employee Information with third parties who provide outsourced human resource functions to us. Digital First Media may disclose your Employee Information if required or permitted to do so by law (such as when part of a governmental agency action or litigation), governmental or quasi-governmental requests, or a regulatory organization, or to relevant third parties such as site technicians, brokers, auditors, lawyers, or professional advisors. In the event that Digital First Media considers it necessary or where required by law to disclose Employee Information, we may share your Employee Information with our outside lawyers, law enforcement, or others who are legally authorized. As Digital First Media continues to develop our business, we may buy or sell assets. In the event that Digital First Media or substantially all of our assets are acquired, Employee Information may be one of the transferred assets.

Digital First Media Cookie Policy


Last Updated May 16, 2018


This Cookie Policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies. This Cookie Policy applies to any website that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. For more information on our privacy practices generally please visit our Privacy Policy.


We may change this Cookie Policy at any time. Please take a look at the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last revised. Any changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on or through the Site. Please note that the names and functionality of cookies, pixels and other technologies may change over time.

What is a cookie?


A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables a variety of features and functionality. Cookies also enable you to easily share content and help us serve relevant ads to you. Cookies can do this because websites can read and write them, enabling websites to recognize you and remember important information that will make your use of a website more convenient (for example by remembering preference settings).


Does Digital First Media use cookies?


Yes. We use cookies and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses our websites has the best possible experience and for marketing purposes. Cookies also help us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit our site or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this policy.


When do we place cookies?


We place cookies when you visit our websites or use certain mobile applications. Any web browser visiting these sites will receive cookies from us. We also place cookies in your browser when you visit non Digital First Media sites that host our plugins or tags.


What types of cookies do we use?


We use a variety of cookie types:


  * Preference Cookies.Preference cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember language or other local settings and customize the websites accordingly.

  * Strictly Necessary Cookies.Strictly necessary cookies are necessary for the website to work and to enable you to move around it and to use its features. Without these absolutely necessary cookies, websites will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like it to and we may not be able to provide the Site or certain services or features you request.
  * Social Plug-in Tracking Cookies.Such cookies are used to track members [and non-members] of social media networks for market research analytics, and product development.
  * Analytics Cookies.Analytics cookies collect information about your use of the websites, and enable us to improve the way they work. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on a website, help us record any difficulties you have with a website, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage, rather than the usage of a single person.
  * Advertising Cookies.Advertising cookies are used for marketing purposes. This is discussed below in greater detail.
  * Affiliate Cookies. Some of our websites may contain promotional links to other companies’ sites. If you follow one of these links or interact with that other site, a cookie is used to tell the other site that you came from one of our websites. That other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral. For more information, see the Internet Advertising Bureau’s guide about how affiliate marketing works.

All of the cookies above are either persistent cookies or session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to the website or interact with our services repeatedly. A persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by the website when you return to one of our websites or a partner site that uses our services. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).


What is Do Not Track (DNT)?


DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. No standard has been adopted to date. As such, we do not generally respond to “do not track” signals.


How are cookies used for advertising purposes?


Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They also help us provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. We may use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may employ cookies and clear GIFs to measure advertising effectiveness. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these third party advertising companies if you have any concerns. Note: Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Ads served by us may also set third party cookies.


Unless you clear these cookies from your browser, we may use this information to:

  * provide more relevant, interest-based advertising
  * provide aggregate reports of ads activity to advertisers and websites hosting the ads
  * help website and app owners understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps
  * detect and defend against fraud and other risks to protect users and partners
  * improve our products

Controlling cookies


Most browsers allow you to control and erase cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. Additionally, some features may work improperly or not at all. It may also stop you from saving customized settings. If you want to another way to clean out all cookies left behind by the websites you have visited, here are links where you can download programs that clean out cookies:

We are not affiliated with any of the products provided above.


If you do not want to receive cookies, you can also change your browser settings on your computer or other device you’re using to access our services. If you use our sites without changing your browser settings, we’ll assume that you’re happy to receive all cookies.
