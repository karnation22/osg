 a vibrant economy with a skilled workforce that attracts employers who seize the opportunities presented by the county’s unique advantages and provide the jobs that create countywide prosperity.


 We envision
 a sustainable system of high‐quality education, community health, public safety, housing, retail, recreation, arts and culture, and infrastructure, in which development complements our natural resources and environment.

San Bernardino County named one of nation’s top “Digital Counties”

Published July 13, 2018 | By Administrator

San Bernardino County has been named one of the nation’s top technology counties by the Center for Digital Government and the National Association of Counties, who recently announced the winners of the 15th anniversary Digital Counties Survey.


The survey identifies the best technology practices among U.S. counties, including initiatives that streamline delivery of government services, encourage open data, collaboration and shared services, enhance cybersecurity and contribute to disaster response and recovery efforts.


San Bernardino County won sixth place among U.S. counties with 1 million or more residents.


“Innovative counties are utilizing technology and data to better inform and protect themselves and their citizens, to save taxpayer money and to provide a better citizen experience,” said Teri Takai, executive director, CDG. “The Center for Digital Government congratulates this year’s winners for all the efforts they are making to improve the lives of their residents and others.”


“Effective technology has proven to be a key tool for efficiency in many facets of county government,” said NACo Executive Director Matthew Chase. “We applaud this year’s Digital Counties Survey winners for showcasing the value of innovation and adaptation. Their embrace of cutting-edge approaches has benefited residents while ensuring good stewardship of taxpayer resources.”

    Good Job SB County. I am so proud to be a citizen of this county. We are very fortunate to have sharp employees working in government to keep our cities up to speed. My question is ” How has the County made sure our young adults remain interested in working for county government so that we may remain relevant in this digital age?” Young people at the community colleges and university level.


    Thank you
