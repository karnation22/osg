The chamber was presumably influenced by Cadiz’ promise of “6,000 jobs” to be created by the project (the adjectives “skilled” and “highly paid” were not used by Cadiz).

By Jim Radcliffe | jradcliffe@scng.com | Orange County Register

PUBLISHED: July 14, 2018 at 6:01 am | UPDATED: July 14, 2018 at 9:48 pm

Q. Honk, can I park on the street and block my own driveway? In my area, I get a lot of apartment and condo visitors parking on the street in front of my house. I put up with it, but it would be nice if they wouldn’t do it on Thanksgiving and Christmas. Those two days really bother me, especially when it is in regard to my immediate neighbors. What your mom once told you is right on: People should be courteous and, if possible, park in front of their friends’ homes when visiting.


– Jim Fuchs, Santa Ana


A. As tempting as it is, Jim, try not to park in front of your driveway.


Cpl. Anthony Bertagna, the spokesman for Santa Ana P.D., said that under the law you cannot park blocking even your own driveway.


“However, as with all tickets, it is at the discretion of the handling officer,” the good corporal said. “Often, if it is at the owner’s residence, they do not cite and just advise them of the law.”


That law, by the way, is from the Califoirnia Vehicle Code, so it covers the entire Golden State.


Q. Honk, the sign below a freeway on-ramp traffic-control light often reads, “One car per green.” Can I take the signage literally – one car per green? Let’s say I am the only car on the ramp and I see green, but it turns red again before I can get there. Can I just continue through without stopping?


– Susan Posilovich, Irvine


A. No.


The point of those ramp meters is to even out the flow of traffic on the freeway, so Honk gets your logic.


But the law is strict: You can only go on a green, even if there was no motorist before you on the ramp for 10 minutes. And the green is so short, don’t try rolling up to it and timing it.


Just stop and wait.


“You are going to treat it like any other red light,” said Duane Graham, an officer and spokesman for the California Highway Patrol out of the agency’s Westminster station house.


Susan, you are obviously asking about this because you want to do the right thing. Plenty of motorists, though, just blow through those red lights knowing they are breaking the law.


Nabbing such cheaters probably isn’t high on most CHP officers’ lists of biggest concerns. But there is a device out there to help them get those who don’t bother stopping when the meter lights are on.


On the backsides of a few ramp meters are lights that allow officers downstream to tell if the meter light is red or green. The cops, in their black-and-whites farther down the ramp pointed toward the freeway, can eyeball the driver and the light in their rear-view mirrors. When a violation occurs, they just drop behind the offenders and pull them over.


That device’s name? A tattletale light.


Honkin’ fact: When a 2-year-old boy died in a hot car in Sacramento over the weekend, it was the 57th time in California a child has died in a hot car since 1990, according to kidsandccars.org, an advocacy group. Each year, the organization says, an average of 37 children die in hot cars in the United States.

Four years after its attendance numbers hit an all-time low, San Bernardino County Museum in 2016-17 continues to make gains in visitors, officials reported earlier this month.


Attendance at the main museum in Redlands slid to 38,000 in 2014 – down from 109,000 in 2001. In the past fiscal year, which ended June 30, attendance at the main museum rose to 63,351, a 66 percent increase from 2014.


Though attendance has yet to return to 2001 levels, museum and county officials are celebrating the turnaround.


“We’re totally excited that more people are coming because ultimately that’s what we want to do,” said museum director Melissa Russo. “We really want to connect residents to the culture and history and environment of the county.”


In 2014, a consulting firm recommended 29 changes at the museum, following revelations about problems in leadership.


Since then, the museum brought on Russo, successfully earned a 10-year accreditation, and has been steadily growing attendance numbers. The museum, based in Redlands with sites in Rancho Cucamonga, Colton, Yucaipa and more, saw a 14 percent increase in visitors to all sites in 2016-17.


At the Victor Valley Museum branch in Apple Valley alone, attendance grew 48 percent in the past year, from 5,523 to 8,222.


Russo said the museum’s success stems from increasing the rate of new exhibits and programs to keep visitors coming back. An increase in school field trips – up to 17,000 from about 13,500 students in the past year at the main museum alone – also helped.


Meanwhile, museum curators are broadening exhibits.

The “Minerals Rock! Unearthing the Human Element” exhibit, which opened July 5 in Redlands, isn’t just about geology, it includes biology and chemistry, and discusses mining in the area, cultural history, the different colors of minerals and how different cultures used them for dying textiles or making jewelry.


“We’re trying to make all of our exhibits very multi-disciplinary so that it tells a fuller story,” Russo said. “So a rock is not just a rock, it’s connected to everything else; it’s part of a story, it’s part of our history, it’s part of the industry of this area.”


“Mechanized Magic: 40 Years of Garner Holt Productions in San Bernardino County,” which runs through Nov. 25 in Redlands, is another crowd-pleaser, she said.


The show follows the rise of the animatronics giant, which was founded in 1977 in Holt’s parents’ San Bernardino garage, offering a look into science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics fields with hands-on opportunities.

In Apple Valley, attendance gains are thanks at least in part to the CuriousCITY exhibit for children under 5, which opened in August, Russo said.


The early-learning interactive play space encourages kids to use their imagination with a city theme, offering post office and store structures, and costumes.


Next up, the museum plans a citrus exhibit tying in agriculture and history. It’s set to open in May, with a tongue-in-cheek working title of “Pulp Culture.”


“We are seeing impressive measureable results in attracting visitors to our county museums,” Board of Supervisors Chairman Robert Lovingood said in a news release from the museum. “I think changes we’ve made in recent years are paying off, and I’m optimistic the trend will continue.”


Attendance, Russo said, is just one data point, “but I think it’s one of the most important ones that illustrates whether or not we’re of interest to the community. That’s our mission. If people aren’t coming, we might as well close our doors.”


The museum aims to exceed 100,000 visitors at the main site in Redlands by 2022.

The man who Redlands police say exposed himself to a woman at a city park before she stabbed him in the back has been charged with indecent exposure.


Ryan Edward Brewer, 28, was arrested about 4 p.m. Tuesday, July 17, at his apartment in Redlands, police spokesman Carl Baker said. The San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office also charged Brewer on Tuesday. His bail was set at $100,000.


Cynthia Christine Molina, 51, was arrested July 11 on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon in what initially was believed to be a random attack. But Brewer withheld information that he argued with and exposed himself to Molina at Jennie Davis Park at Redlands Boulevard and New York Street, police said.


Molina on Monday pleaded not guilty. She is due back in court July 24 for a hearing.

PUBLISHED: July 6, 2018 at 6:34 pm | UPDATED: July 9, 2018 at 2:13 pm

A judge has ruled against Highland’s proposed 3,600-house Harmony development, partially siding with environmental and community groups that opposed the massive project in two related lawsuits.


The suits, filed in September 2016, challenged the city’s approval of the project due to what they called an “inadequate” environmental report.


Superior Court Judge Donald Alvarez found the report failed to analyze the entire scope of the project in leaving out a needed bridge over Mill Creek. Impacts on flooding, and to water and wildlife habitat were also not fully considered, he said.

Petitioners in both suits sought to throw out the city’s certification of the report and approvals of the project. City officials and the developer now are determining what they’ll do next.


Larry Mainez, the city’s community development director, said Thursday the city had just received word about the ruling and was still figuring out how to proceed. The rulings, filed in late June, had been mailed to the parties, and were received Thursday.


“We received the ruling, and our team is reviewing it,” said Randall Lewis, executive vice president of developer Lewis Group of Companies. “We will be deciding what the next steps are.”


This map from the Harmony Specific Plan environmental impact report shows the Highland housing project, outlined in red, in relation to nearby cities and roads.

In fall 2016, the Highland City Council consented to putting the Harmony master planned community before voters in November 2018, reversing course on its approval of the project after opponents gathered enough signatures to force a recall or seek voter input. The council had approved the project in August 2016.


At that point Mayor Larry McCallon had said placing the matter on the ballot likely would not impact the construction timeline.


“It was never envisioned construction would start for the next three, four or five years, anyway,” he had said.


McCallon did not return multiple phone calls by late afternoon Friday.


“The next step will be determining what the remedy the Judge will issue since the Petition was granted in part and denied in part,” said Aruna Prabhala, an attorney with petitioner Center for Biological Diversity in an email. “…The Judge found the environmental impact report was inadequate on a number of issues which will likely have to be addressed before the project moves forward.”


When the remedy will be issued is uncertain as it hinges on the completion of several procedural steps, she said.


A similar ruling was recently handed down for what would be one of the nation’s largest warehouse facilities proposed for eastern Moreno Valley. On June 14 Riverside County Superior Court Judge Sharon J. Waters tossed out the World Logistics Center project’s environmental report, setting aside that city’s approvals, and barring it from issuing any permits.


The Greenspot lawsuit


On June 27 Alvarez filed a ruling on a suit bought by the Center, the Greenspot Residents Association and the San Bernardino Valley Audobon Society. The lawsuit contended the environmental report excluded the construction of the Newport Avenue bridge over Mill Creek as part of the project. The claim said the proposed bridge would need to include room for wildlife to pass under it due to the location of wildlife corridors at the boundaries of the project site. Alvarez ruled that the bridge should be considered part of the project.


That suit also suggested the report improperly concluded the project’s greenhouse gas emissions would be less than significant. The judge denied this, saying evidence supported the methodology used for compliance with state emission reduction rules.


The third piece of the suit claimed the environmental report failed to address the amount of fill needed to raise a portion of the site out of the 100-year floodplain, and the downstream impacts of the grading needed at the project’s southern boundary.


Alvarez ruled the exact plan to raise homes out of the flood plain was less than certain at the time the city had approved the report as the Federal Emergency Management Agency had not yet reviewed and approved detailed hydrological analyses for the zone.


The report’s discussion of water drainage from the foothills northeast of the site was also lacking according to the judge. At the time the report was approved runoff rates had not yet been determined. Determinations regarding impacts and mitigation measures require completed studies, Alvarez ruled.

“(My neighbors) are ecstatic,” said Wendy Rea, founder of the Greenspot Residents Association, and a longtime resident of Mentone and Redlands. “I think many people in the community had lost hope.”


“Our concerns,” she added, “were with understanding the heritage of flood history of this area and the risks were just simply being ignored,” she said.


The ruling, she said, has restored their faith.


Another lawsuit


Alvarez filed a 90-page ruling June 26 in a related suit brought by the Sierra Club, Crafton Hills Open Space Conservancy, Tri-County Conservation League and Friends of Riverside Hills.

Alvarez granted a similar point about the city failing to analyze the whole of the project by excluding the bridge, and said there is no substantial evidence supporting the city’s conclusions regarding project alternatives, and impacts on alluvial fan sage scrub habitat, water resources, wastewater and energy conservation.


He found evidence supports the city’s conclusions on impacts to a different sage scrub habitat, wildlife corridors, earthquake risk, aesthetics, wildfire hazards, hazardous materials, cultural resources and greenhouse gas emissions.


“It’s a great next step,” Rea of the Highland rulings. “We’ve let the system carry it forward and now we’ll see what their next move is.”

The statistical geeks at WalletHub, Bankrate and Kiplinger’s recently took their respective shots at measuring how each state compares in terms of livability factors for your retirement years: from costs to culture to that critical aging issue, healthcare.


Let’s politely say the conclusions varied.


So who’s correct? Who do you trust? Retirement choices are no small matter.


Let me take a literal middle ground by considering their collective wisdom. As a public service, my trusty spreadsheet helped me combine this trio of retirement location rankings to give a better picture of the varying strengths vs. weaknesses of the states.


I reassembled their published ranking data — overall scores, subindex grades and related data — into three evenly weighted metrics: costs (buying power); character (culture and climate); and care (healthcare and healthiness). What did I learn?


Florida is the place to retire, statistically speaking to my composite index. It ranked No. 1 for costs and character. But if you don’t care for humidity, and enjoy winter’s chill, No. 2 was South Dakota, which enjoyed No. 4 grades for costs and care.


Third-ranked was New Hampshire (No. 4 for character; 10th-best for care), then Virginia: (ninth-best for character) and Hawaii (No. 40 for costs but No. 1 for care!)


Conversely, don’t think about Louisiana for your golden years, according to my math. It ranked last in my reassembled scorecard. Why? No. 49 for character and No. 50 for care.


Next worst score was Arkansas (No. 47 for character), then came Kentucky (No. 47 for care); New Mexico (No. 46 for character) and Illinois (No. 41 for care).


What about California? By my math, the Golden State ranked a middle-of-the-pack 26th for one’s golden years. California’s seventh-worst ranking for costs was improved by a No. 16 grade for character and No. 18 for care.


Here is how the 50 states ranked as retirement options in order of my overall scoring then broken down by ranking for cost, character and care quality.

The statistical geeks at WalletHub, Bankrate and Kiplinger’s recently took their respective shots at measuring how each state compares in terms of livability factors for your retirement years: from costs to culture to that critical aging issue, healthcare.


Let’s politely say the conclusions varied.


So who’s correct? Who do you trust? Retirement choices are no small matter.


Let me take a literal middle ground by considering their collective wisdom. As a public service, my trusty spreadsheet helped me combine this trio of retirement location rankings to give a better picture of the varying strengths vs. weaknesses of the states.


I reassembled their published ranking data — overall scores, subindex grades and related data — into three evenly weighted metrics: costs (buying power); character (culture and climate); and care (healthcare and healthiness). What did I learn?


Florida is the place to retire, statistically speaking to my composite index. It ranked No. 1 for costs and character. But if you don’t care for humidity, and enjoy winter’s chill, No. 2 was South Dakota, which enjoyed No. 4 grades for costs and care.


Third-ranked was New Hampshire (No. 4 for character; 10th-best for care), then Virginia: (ninth-best for character) and Hawaii (No. 40 for costs but No. 1 for care!)


Conversely, don’t think about Louisiana for your golden years, according to my math. It ranked last in my reassembled scorecard. Why? No. 49 for character and No. 50 for care.


Next worst score was Arkansas (No. 47 for character), then came Kentucky (No. 47 for care); New Mexico (No. 46 for character) and Illinois (No. 41 for care).


What about California? By my math, the Golden State ranked a middle-of-the-pack 26th for one’s golden years. California’s seventh-worst ranking for costs was improved by a No. 16 grade for character and No. 18 for care.


Here is how the 50 states ranked as retirement options in order of my overall scoring then broken down by ranking for cost, character and care quality.

Rank State          Cost Character Care
1    Florida        1    1         2   
2    South Dakota   4    20        1   
3    New Hampshire  22   4         3   
4    Virginia       18   9         6   
5    Hawaii         40   8         12  
6    Utah           7    33        4

The statistical geeks at WalletHub, Bankrate and Kiplinger’s recently took their respective shots at measuring how each state compares in terms of livability factors for your retirement years: from costs to culture to that critical aging issue, healthcare.


Let’s politely say the conclusions varied.


So who’s correct? Who do you trust? Retirement choices are no small matter.


Let me take a literal middle ground by considering their collective wisdom. As a public service, my trusty spreadsheet helped me combine this trio of retirement location rankings to give a better picture of the varying strengths vs. weaknesses of the states.


I reassembled their published ranking data — overall scores, subindex grades and related data — into three evenly weighted metrics: costs (buying power); character (culture and climate); and care (healthcare and healthiness). What did I learn?


Florida is the place to retire, statistically speaking to my composite index. It ranked No. 1 for costs and character. But if you don’t care for humidity, and enjoy winter’s chill, No. 2 was South Dakota, which enjoyed No. 4 grades for costs and care.


Third-ranked was New Hampshire (No. 4 for character; 10th-best for care), then Virginia: (ninth-best for character) and Hawaii (No. 40 for costs but No. 1 for care!)


Conversely, don’t think about Louisiana for your golden years, according to my math. It ranked last in my reassembled scorecard. Why? No. 49 for character and No. 50 for care.


Next worst score was Arkansas (No. 47 for character), then came Kentucky (No. 47 for care); New Mexico (No. 46 for character) and Illinois (No. 41 for care).


What about California? By my math, the Golden State ranked a middle-of-the-pack 26th for one’s golden years. California’s seventh-worst ranking for costs was improved by a No. 16 grade for character and No. 18 for care.


Here is how the 50 states ranked as retirement options in order of my overall scoring then broken down by ranking for cost, character and care quality.

Rank State          Cost Character Care
1    Florida        1    1         2   
2    South Dakota   4    20        1   
3    New Hampshire  22   4         3

MORENO VALLEY — A wild burro was shot with an arrow, but eluded rescue efforts Wednesday.


Riverside County Department of Animal Services spokesman John Welsh said the feral donkey was wounded over the weekend, and a concerned resident posted images of the animal to social media, catching the attention of authorities.


Welsh described the attack on the burro as a “terrible act of cruelty” that left the animal in need of veterinary care.


The burro was spotted in the Reche Canyon area, in the vicinity of the Black Stallion Ranch, north of Moreno Valley, and animal control officers went to the location Wednesday afternoon, Welsh said.


“We shot it with two tranquilizer darts, but efforts to capture the wild burro were unsuccessful,” Welsh said. “The darts should have been enough, and we are uncertain why they were not effective.


“It could have been a result of the animal being worked up earlier, prior to our arrival,” he said.


The arrow was no longer protruding from the creature when the darts were injected, but the wound was still visible, according to Welsh


Officers will return to the area Thursday morning to have another go at corralling the burro.


Welsh said the nonprofit DonkeyLand rescue organization has been alerted and will be enlisted to assist.


Officials asked anyone with information regarding who might have injured the donkey to contact the Department of Animal Services at (951) 358-7387.


Herds of wild burros populate the Pigeon Pass and Reche Canyon areas between Moreno Valley and Colton. Riverside County Ordinance No. 934 makes it unlawful to feed, pet or otherwise draw the donkeys toward roadsides and other locations where they might be hurt — or wander into traffic and cause accidents.

MORENO VALLEY — A wild burro was shot with an arrow, but eluded rescue efforts Wednesday.


Riverside County Department of Animal Services spokesman John Welsh said the feral donkey was wounded over the weekend, and a concerned resident posted images of the animal to social media, catching the attention of authorities.


Welsh described the attack on the burro as a “terrible act of cruelty” that left the animal in need of veterinary care.


The burro was spotted in the Reche Canyon area, in the vicinity of the Black Stallion Ranch, north of Moreno Valley, and animal control officers went to the location Wednesday afternoon, Welsh said.


“We shot it with two tranquilizer darts, but efforts to capture the wild burro were unsuccessful,” Welsh said. “The darts should have been enough, and we are uncertain why they were not effective.


“It could have been a result of the animal being worked up earlier, prior to our arrival,” he said.


The arrow was no longer protruding from the creature when the darts were injected, but the wound was still visible, according to Welsh


Officers will return to the area Thursday morning to have another go at corralling the burro.


Welsh said the nonprofit DonkeyLand rescue organization has been alerted and will be enlisted to assist.


Officials asked anyone with information regarding who might have injured the donkey to contact the Department of Animal Services at (951) 358-7387.


Herds of wild burros populate the Pigeon Pass and Reche Canyon areas between Moreno Valley and Colton. Riverside County Ordinance No. 934 makes it unlawful to feed, pet or otherwise draw the donkeys toward roadsides and other locations where they might be hurt — or wander into traffic and cause accidents.

A 49-year-old Ontario resident was arrested Wednesday, July 18, on suspicion of child molestation.


Ernesto Santos is believed to have molested a family member numerous times, an Ontario police news release said. He was arrested in the 1000 block of North Mountain Avenue on suspicion of lewd and lascivious acts with a child younger than 14. He is being held at West Valley Detention Center in lieu of $500,000 bail.


Investigators believe Santos may have sexually assaulted other children, the release said. They ask anyone with information to call Detective Dave Newland at 909-408-1898 or 909-986-6711, or report tips anonymously to We-Tip at 800-782-7463 or to its website at wetip.com.

A 49-year-old Ontario resident was arrested Wednesday, July 18, on suspicion of child molestation.


Ernesto Santos is believed to have molested a family member numerous times, an Ontario police news release said. He was arrested in the 1000 block of North Mountain Avenue on suspicion of lewd and lascivious acts with a child younger than 14. He is being held at West Valley Detention Center in lieu of $500,000 bail.


Investigators believe Santos may have sexually assaulted other children, the release said. They ask anyone with information to call Detective Dave Newland at 909-408-1898 or 909-986-6711, or report tips anonymously to We-Tip at 800-782-7463 or to its website at wetip.com.

The search for a hiker who was reported missing in Joshua Tree National Park on Friday was scaled back Wednesday, July 18, after another day of no sign of the man.


Paul Miller, 51, of Canada, was last seen by his wife about 9 a.m. Friday when he left for a hike on the 49 Palms Oasis trail. She reported him overdue about noon. His car was found in the parking lot at the trailhead.

At its height, the operation included 90 ground searchers, six K-9 teams, an ATV search team and a helicopter. Searchers will continue to look in areas with the highest probability of success, a Facebook post by the National Park Service said.


Officials ask that anyone with information on Miller’s whereabouts or who has any other helpful details call 909-383-5651.

The search for a hiker who was reported missing in Joshua Tree National Park on Friday was scaled back Wednesday, July 18, after another day of no sign of the man.


Paul Miller, 51, of Canada, was last seen by his wife about 9 a.m. Friday when he left for a hike on the 49 Palms Oasis trail. She reported him overdue about noon. His car was found in the parking lot at the trailhead.

At its height, the operation included 90 ground searchers, six K-9 teams, an ATV search team and a helicopter. Searchers will continue to look in areas with the highest probability of success, a Facebook post by the National Park Service said.


Officials ask that anyone with information on Miller’s whereabouts or who has any other helpful details call 909-383-5651.

The 16-year-old gunshot victim who had been dropped behind a 7-Eleven in Yucaipa on Saturday by motorists who then fled had earlier attempted to burglarize the home of a 69-year-old man who owns a gun, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said.


The teenage boy, who is a Desert Hot Springs resident, and two other men had tried to break in to a home in the 33000 block of Wallace Way in Yucaipa, a news release said. The homeowner confronted the three as they tried to force their way through a backyard window. As they fled, he fired one shot, striking the teen.


The driver of the vehicle was seen placing the teen on the ground behind the 7-Eleven near Yucaipa Boulevard and 14th Street just before 6:15 p.m. and then driving off. The homeowner reported the burglary 30 minutes later but not the shooting, the release said.

Tuesday, detectives found evidence at the home that the 69-year-old had fired his gun. They also found the Ford Mustang GT driven by the burglars, the release said. Detectives are trying to find the two men and a woman who were in the car and left the 16-year-old behind.


No one has been arrested and the names of those involved have not been publicly released. The District Attorney’s Office will determine whether to bring charges.


Deputies ask anyone with information about the incident to call Deputy Coillot at the Yucaipa Station, 909-918-2305. Anonymous calls can be made to the We-Tip Hotline at 800-782-7463 or the website at wetip.com.

The 16-year-old gunshot victim who had been dropped behind a 7-Eleven in Yucaipa on Saturday by motorists who then fled had earlier attempted to burglarize the home of a 69-year-old man who owns a gun, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said.


The teenage boy, who is a Desert Hot Springs resident, and two other men had tried to break in to a home in the 33000 block of Wallace Way in Yucaipa, a news release said. The homeowner confronted the three as they tried to force their way through a backyard window. As they fled, he fired one shot, striking the teen.


The driver of the vehicle was seen placing the teen on the ground behind the 7-Eleven near Yucaipa Boulevard and 14th Street just before 6:15 p.m. and then driving off. The homeowner reported the burglary 30 minutes later but not the shooting, the release said.

Tuesday, detectives found evidence at the home that the 69-year-old had fired his gun. They also found the Ford Mustang GT driven by the burglars, the release said. Detectives are trying to find the two men and a woman who were in the car and left the 16-year-old behind.


No one has been arrested and the names of those involved have not been publicly released. The District Attorney’s Office will determine whether to bring charges.


Deputies ask anyone with information about the incident to call Deputy Coillot at the Yucaipa Station, 909-918-2305. Anonymous calls can be made to the We-Tip Hotline at 800-782-7463 or the website at wetip.com.

Four years after its attendance numbers hit an all-time low, San Bernardino County Museum in 2016-17 continues to make gains in visitors, officials reported earlier this month.


Attendance at the main museum in Redlands slid to 38,000 in 2014 – down from 109,000 in 2001. In the past fiscal year, which ended June 30, attendance at the main museum rose to 63,351, a 66 percent increase from 2014.


Though attendance has yet to return to 2001 levels, museum and county officials are celebrating the turnaround.


“We’re totally excited that more people are coming because ultimately that’s what we want to do,” said museum director Melissa Russo. “We really want to connect residents to the culture and history and environment of the county.”


In 2014, a consulting firm recommended 29 changes at the museum, following revelations about problems in leadership.


Since then, the museum brought on Russo, successfully earned a 10-year accreditation, and has been steadily growing attendance numbers. The museum, based in Redlands with sites in Rancho Cucamonga, Colton, Yucaipa and more, saw a 14 percent increase in visitors to all sites in 2016-17.


At the Victor Valley Museum branch in Apple Valley alone, attendance grew 48 percent in the past year, from 5,523 to 8,222.


Russo said the museum’s success stems from increasing the rate of new exhibits and programs to keep visitors coming back. An increase in school field trips – up to 17,000 from about 13,500 students in the past year at the main museum alone – also helped.


Meanwhile, museum curators are broadening exhibits.

The “Minerals Rock! Unearthing the Human Element” exhibit, which opened July 5 in Redlands, isn’t just about geology, it includes biology and chemistry, and discusses mining in the area, cultural history, the different colors of minerals and how different cultures used them for dying textiles or making jewelry.


“We’re trying to make all of our exhibits very multi-disciplinary so that it tells a fuller story,” Russo said. “So a rock is not just a rock, it’s connected to everything else; it’s part of a story, it’s part of our history, it’s part of the industry of this area.”


“Mechanized Magic: 40 Years of Garner Holt Productions in San Bernardino County,” which runs through Nov. 25 in Redlands, is another crowd-pleaser, she said.


The show follows the rise of the animatronics giant, which was founded in 1977 in Holt’s parents’ San Bernardino garage, offering a look into science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics fields with hands-on opportunities.

In Apple Valley, attendance gains are thanks at least in part to the CuriousCITY exhibit for children under 5, which opened in August, Russo said.


The early-learning interactive play space encourages kids to use their imagination with a city theme, offering post office and store structures, and costumes.


Next up, the museum plans a citrus exhibit tying in agriculture and history. It’s set to open in May, with a tongue-in-cheek working title of “Pulp Culture.”


“We are seeing impressive measureable results in attracting visitors to our county museums,” Board of Supervisors Chairman Robert Lovingood said in a news release from the museum. “I think changes we’ve made in recent years are paying off, and I’m optimistic the trend will continue.”


Attendance, Russo said, is just one data point, “but I think it’s one of the most important ones that illustrates whether or not we’re of interest to the community. That’s our mission. If people aren’t coming, we might as well close our doors.”


The museum aims to exceed 100,000 visitors at the main site in Redlands by 2022.

Four years after its attendance numbers hit an all-time low, San Bernardino County Museum in 2016-17 continues to make gains in visitors, officials reported earlier this month.


Attendance at the main museum in Redlands slid to 38,000 in 2014 – down from 109,000 in 2001. In the past fiscal year, which ended June 30, attendance at the main museum rose to 63,351, a 66 percent increase from 2014.


Though attendance has yet to return to 2001 levels, museum and county officials are celebrating the turnaround.


“We’re totally excited that more people are coming because ultimately that’s what we want to do,” said museum director Melissa Russo. “We really want to connect residents to the culture and history and environment of the county.”


In 2014, a consulting firm recommended 29 changes at the museum, following revelations about problems in leadership.


Since then, the museum brought on Russo, successfully earned a 10-year accreditation, and has been steadily growing attendance numbers. The museum, based in Redlands with sites in Rancho Cucamonga, Colton, Yucaipa and more, saw a 14 percent increase in visitors to all sites in 2016-17.


At the Victor Valley Museum branch in Apple Valley alone, attendance grew 48 percent in the past year, from 5,523 to 8,222.


Russo said the museum’s success stems from increasing the rate of new exhibits and programs to keep visitors coming back. An increase in school field trips – up to 17,000 from about 13,500 students in the past year at the main museum alone – also helped.


Meanwhile, museum curators are broadening exhibits.

The “Minerals Rock! Unearthing the Human Element” exhibit, which opened July 5 in Redlands, isn’t just about geology, it includes biology and chemistry, and discusses mining in the area, cultural history, the different colors of minerals and how different cultures used them for dying textiles or making jewelry.


“We’re trying to make all of our exhibits very multi-disciplinary so that it tells a fuller story,” Russo said. “So a rock is not just a rock, it’s connected to everything else; it’s part of a story, it’s part of our history, it’s part of the industry of this area.”


“Mechanized Magic: 40 Years of Garner Holt Productions in San Bernardino County,” which runs through Nov. 25 in Redlands, is another crowd-pleaser, she said.


The show follows the rise of the animatronics giant, which was founded in 1977 in Holt’s parents’ San Bernardino garage, offering a look into science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics fields with hands-on opportunities.

In Apple Valley, attendance gains are thanks at least in part to the CuriousCITY exhibit for children under 5, which opened in August, Russo said.


The early-learning interactive play space encourages kids to use their imagination with a city theme, offering post office and store structures, and costumes.


Next up, the museum plans a citrus exhibit tying in agriculture and history. It’s set to open in May, with a tongue-in-cheek working title of “Pulp Culture.”


“We are seeing impressive measureable results in attracting visitors to our county museums,” Board of Supervisors Chairman Robert Lovingood said in a news release from the museum. “I think changes we’ve made in recent years are paying off, and I’m optimistic the trend will continue.”


Attendance, Russo said, is just one data point, “but I think it’s one of the most important ones that illustrates whether or not we’re of interest to the community. That’s our mission. If people aren’t coming, we might as well close our doors.”


The museum aims to exceed 100,000 visitors at the main site in Redlands by 2022.

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 5:10 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 5:11 pm

The Redlands City Council on Tuesday, July 17, tabled a resolution created to alleviate some of the State Street congestion leading up to Thursday Market Nights, but the city is still working on the problem.


An increase in downtown visitors over the past few years has led to problems for State Street shops, and Market Night vendors.


“We are victims of our success downtown, and that’s what we are grappling with,” said Mayor Paul Foster.


Patrons of the brick and mortar stores have to leave parking spaces by 5:30 p.m., but were sometimes blocked by vendors setting up for the 6 p.m. event, according to complaints received by city staff.


The city changed vendor set-up time to 5:30 p.m. in May, but some vendors, especially those selling food, had problems setting up in half an hour. When many cars needed to be towed, on a recent night there were 20, vendors had to wait even longer until they got the chance to set up.


And 6 p.m. is prime selling time, farmer and vendor Bill Cunningham told the council. The proposal the council tabled had been to push back the start time to 6:30 p.m.


City staff said they would look into posting more signs to make sure patrons know they need to move their cars by 5:30 p.m., and will also talk to vendors, especially local farmers, and State Street business owners to find a solution.


The matter will be in front of the City Council again in September when they return from their August break.

By Jennifer Iyer | jiyer@scng.com | Redlands Daily Facts

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 5:10 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 5:11 pm

The Redlands City Council on Tuesday, July 17, tabled a resolution created to alleviate some of the State Street congestion leading up to Thursday Market Nights, but the city is still working on the problem.


An increase in downtown visitors over the past few years has led to problems for State Street shops, and Market Night vendors.


“We are victims of our success downtown, and that’s what we are grappling with,” said Mayor Paul Foster.


Patrons of the brick and mortar stores have to leave parking spaces by 5:30 p.m., but were sometimes blocked by vendors setting up for the 6 p.m. event, according to complaints received by city staff.


The city changed vendor set-up time to 5:30 p.m. in May, but some vendors, especially those selling food, had problems setting up in half an hour. When many cars needed to be towed, on a recent night there were 20, vendors had to wait even longer until they got the chance to set up.


And 6 p.m. is prime selling time, farmer and vendor Bill Cunningham told the council. The proposal the council tabled had been to push back the start time to 6:30 p.m.


City staff said they would look into posting more signs to make sure patrons know they need to move their cars by 5:30 p.m., and will also talk to vendors, especially local farmers, and State Street business owners to find a solution.


The matter will be in front of the City Council again in September when they return from their August break.

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 4:32 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 9:44 pm

A Southern California car wash mogul cited for cheating more than 800 workers and destroying evidence will pay $4.2 million in back wages and penalties after a two-year court battle with federal authorities.


Vahid David Delrahim, of Los Angeles, failed to pay his workers minimum wage or overtime at a dozen car washes in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.


A consent decree approved this week by U.S. District Court Judge Fernando Olguin orders Delrahim to pay $1.9 million in back wages and another $1.9 million in damages to the workers. In addition, he is fined $400,000 in civil penalties.


“This landmark case sends a powerful message that the Department of Labor will use strong law enforcement and litigation tools to protect employees and level the playing field for law-abiding employers,” said Juan Coria, the wage and hour division’s acting regional commissioner.


According to the judgment, Delrahim ordered employees, many of them Spanish-speakers unfamiliar with U.S. labor laws, to work off the clock at the beginning of each shift and to clock out, but to remain at the car washes, when business was slow. The result: numerous hours without pay.


The court-ordered back wages cover a period from 2013 to the present. More workers and more money may be added to the case, according to the 42-page decree, as “the identity of all employees who worked [at the 12 car washes] is presently unknown.”


Delrahim is required to furnish more names, addresses and workplace records—originally requested by prosecutors in 2016—within 30 days.


As a result of the judgment, some employees will receive more than $10,000 in back wages.


Delrahim, a prominent member of Southern California’s Iranian diaspora and a cousin of President Donald Trump’s anti-trust chief, Makan Delrahim, owns more than 100 car washes and gas stations through Agoura Hills-based companies: Brea Car Wash & Detail Center (also known as Southwest Fuel Management), Goldenwest Solutions Group, and California Payroll Group.

“We made a business decision to end the civil litigation,” his public relations firm said in a statement. “Our decision did not admit any wrongdoing on our part, but will enable the leaders and employees of our business to focus their time and effort on business instead of a costly civil trial.”


State and federal officials bring hundreds of wage theft claims each year against California car washes, garment contractors, caregiver facilities, restaurants and construction firms—the industries with the highest number of violations.


The Delrahim case is unusual in that few wage and hour disputes end up in court. But Delrahim hired one of the nation’s most aggressive employer law firms, Littler Mendelson, leading to two years of court battles and more than 200,000 pages in filings, documents, depositions and testimony.


Delrahim’s Los Angeles-based lawyer, Rebecca Aragon, specialized in helping “companies employing Spanish-speaking work forces” with “union avoidance” and other strategies, according to her firm biography.


The case exploded into a fight over legal ethics. Shortly after the investigation began, Delrahim and Littler were notified of the duty to preserve potential evidence. Nonetheless, text messages, email accounts and videos recording workers’ comings and goings, which prosecutors deemed likely to prove the government’s case, were destroyed.


The court sanctioned Delrahim and Littler five times for withholding documents and for coercive tactics towards employee witnesses. They were ordered to reimburse the government $23,850 in legal fees.


“The court’s decisions make clear that our laws protect workers and neither an employer nor their attorneys may interfere with their rights,” said Regional Solicitor Janet Herold.


The settlement attested to the lack of trust. It orders Delrahim not to encourage his managers “to ensure that labor costs are kept at or below a fixed percentage of the car wash’s sales.” And it appoints an “independent monitor” who can enter his car washes for a year without prior notice to inspect all payroll records and time cards.

A Southern California car wash mogul cited for cheating more than 800 workers and destroying evidence will pay $4.2 million in back wages and penalties after a two-year court battle with federal authorities.


Vahid David Delrahim, of Los Angeles, failed to pay his workers minimum wage or overtime at a dozen car washes in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.


A consent decree approved this week by U.S. District Court Judge Fernando Olguin orders Delrahim to pay $1.9 million in back wages and another $1.9 million in damages to the workers. In addition, he is fined $400,000 in civil penalties.

Delrahim, a prominent member of Southern California’s Iranian diaspora and a cousin of President Donald Trump’s anti-trust chief, Makan Delrahim, owns more than 100 car washes and gas stations through Agoura Hills-based companies: Brea Car Wash & Detail Center (also known as Southwest Fuel Management), Goldenwest Solutions Group, and California Payroll Group.

The court-ordered back wages cover a period from 2013 to the present. More workers and more money may be added to the case, according to the 42-page decree, as “the identity of all employees who worked [at the 12 car washes] is presently unknown.”


Delrahim is required to furnish more names, addresses and workplace records—originally requested by prosecutors in 2016—within 30 days.


As a result of the judgment, some employees will receive more than $10,000 in back wages.


Delrahim, a prominent member of Southern California’s Iranian diaspora and a cousin of President Donald Trump’s anti-trust chief, Makan Delrahim, owns more than 100 car washes and gas stations through Agoura Hills-based companies: Brea Car Wash & Detail Center (also known as Southwest Fuel Management), Goldenwest Solutions Group, and California Payroll Group.

“We made a business decision to end the civil litigation,” his public relations firm said in a statement. “Our decision did not admit any wrongdoing on our part, but will enable the leaders and employees of our business to focus their time and effort on business instead of a costly civil trial.”


State and federal officials bring hundreds of wage theft claims each year against California car washes, garment contractors, caregiver facilities, restaurants and construction firms—the industries with the highest number of violations.


The Delrahim case is unusual in that few wage and hour disputes end up in court. But Delrahim hired one of the nation’s most aggressive employer law firms, Littler Mendelson, leading to two years of court battles and more than 200,000 pages in filings, documents, depositions and testimony.


Delrahim’s Los Angeles-based lawyer, Rebecca Aragon, specialized in helping “companies employing Spanish-speaking work forces” with “union avoidance” and other strategies, according to her firm biography.


The case exploded into a fight over legal ethics. Shortly after the investigation began, Delrahim and Littler were notified of the duty to preserve potential evidence. Nonetheless, text messages, email accounts and videos recording workers’ comings and goings, which prosecutors deemed likely to prove the government’s case, were destroyed.


The court sanctioned Delrahim and Littler five times for withholding documents and for coercive tactics towards employee witnesses. They were ordered to reimburse the government $23,850 in legal fees.


“The court’s decisions make clear that our laws protect workers and neither an employer nor their attorneys may interfere with their rights,” said Regional Solicitor Janet Herold.


The settlement attested to the lack of trust. It orders Delrahim not to encourage his managers “to ensure that labor costs are kept at or below a fixed percentage of the car wash’s sales.” And it appoints an “independent monitor” who can enter his car washes for a year without prior notice to inspect all payroll records and time cards.

  * Steve’s Detailing (Newport Beach)

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 2:17 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 5:49 pm

Raudel Felix García of Fontana thought someone was playing a cruel joke on him when he was told a decade ago that his brother had died after working in the grape fields of Kern County.


Audon Felix García had arrived from Zacatecas, Mexico just days before to work in the fields as he had done every other summer, his brother said. But the 41-year-old died two days after starting work loading boxes on the company truck, he said, due to temperatures that reached 112 degrees that summer day and employer “negligence” to properly care for him.


“It was hard to believe that he was simply gone,” a highly emotional Raudel Felix García, who owns his own landscaping business, said Tuesday in a media teleconference. “I had seen Audon five days before his death. He was healthy and ready to start another harvesting season.”

Now, Raudel Felix García is among those who are calling for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to establish the first federal standard that would protect workers from exposure to excessive heat.


“I don’t want any more families to go through the pain that my family went through,” he said.


RELATED STORY: U.S. Postal Service worker found dead in Woodland Hills amid Friday’s record-breaking heat


More than 100 labor, public health, environmental justice and environmental groups along with former occupational regulators and other individual petitioners submitted a petition to the federal agency calling for national protections for workers – both indoor and outdoor – who are at risk from extreme heat.


It marks the launch of a national campaign by the consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen, the United Farm Workers Foundation and Farmworker Justice and others in an effort to raise awareness about the effects of climate change on workers’ health and safety.


“Preventing heat illness is urgently needed now more than ever,” Ellen Widess, a former Cal/OSHA chief and a board member of Farmworker Justice, said on the call. “Given climate change, rising heat, high-heat incidents and expanding areas of California and the nation which experience high heat, we have to do something.”


U.S. Rep. Judy Chu, D-Pasadena, said she plans to introduce legislation in Congress that would require the federal government to develop federal heat protection standards. These standards would likely require employers to provide workplaces with water, shade and rest breaks if needed to recover from the heat, similar to what California already requires.


The planned legislation would also direct employers to provide training for employees about risk factors that can lead to heat illness, Chu said.


“All workers should benefit from safe conditions whenever they work outside in the heat no matter where they are,” she said.


RELATED STORY: Federal investigators launch probe into Woodland Hills mail carrier’s death on 117-degree day


Locally, the issue of working in extreme heat gained attention recently after U.S. postal carrier Peggy Frank, 63, was found dead July 6 in her mail truck on a 117-degree day in Woodland Hills. Authorities, including OSHA, are probing whether heat was a factor.


Employers are obligated to protect employees from any hazardous condition, including potential heat stress, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.


In the case of the U.S. Postal Service, carriers are reminded daily to stay hydrated throughout their route, wear appropriate clothing, such as hats, and get into the shade whenever and as much as possible, officials said.


In 2005, after a series of farmworker deaths, California became the first state in the country to issue comprehensive heat standard protections for workers. Those regulations were strengthened a decade later and have likely saved lives, activists and experts say.


While there have been some tragic cases of heat-related deaths in the state since then, Chu said it’s probably related to enforcement of the state’s regulations.


“We feel it’s related to whether there are people being sent out to see whether employers are really doing their job and whether they are holding them accountable,” she said.


Chu added that she’s hopeful that the new legislation will tackle this problem.

That sentiment was echoed by Widess, the former Cal/Osha chief, who said that even in a state like California, it’s important to increase enforcement capacity of regulatory agencies.


“More inspectors are needed to make sure employers are doing right by workers, taking every step needed, and OSHA is chronically understaffed nationally,” she said.

Raudel Felix García of Fontana thought someone was playing a cruel joke on him when he was told a decade ago that his brother had died after working in the grape fields of Kern County.


Audon Felix García had arrived from Zacatecas, Mexico just days before to work in the fields as he had done every other summer, his brother said. But the 41-year-old died two days after starting work loading boxes on the company truck, he said, due to temperatures that reached 112 degrees that summer day and employer “negligence” to properly care for him.


“It was hard to believe that he was simply gone,” a highly emotional Raudel Felix García, who owns his own landscaping business, said Tuesday in a media teleconference. “I had seen Audon five days before his death. He was healthy and ready to start another harvesting season.”

Now, Raudel Felix García is among those who are calling for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to establish the first federal standard that would protect workers from exposure to excessive heat.


“I don’t want any more families to go through the pain that my family went through,” he said.


RELATED STORY: U.S. Postal Service worker found dead in Woodland Hills amid Friday’s record-breaking heat


More than 100 labor, public health, environmental justice and environmental groups along with former occupational regulators and other individual petitioners submitted a petition to the federal agency calling for national protections for workers – both indoor and outdoor – who are at risk from extreme heat.


It marks the launch of a national campaign by the consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen, the United Farm Workers Foundation and Farmworker Justice and others in an effort to raise awareness about the effects of climate change on workers’ health and safety.


“Preventing heat illness is urgently needed now more than ever,” Ellen Widess, a former Cal/OSHA chief and a board member of Farmworker Justice, said on the call. “Given climate change, rising heat, high-heat incidents and expanding areas of California and the nation which experience high heat, we have to do something.”


U.S. Rep. Judy Chu, D-Pasadena, said she plans to introduce legislation in Congress that would require the federal government to develop federal heat protection standards. These standards would likely require employers to provide workplaces with water, shade and rest breaks if needed to recover from the heat, similar to what California already requires.


The planned legislation would also direct employers to provide training for employees about risk factors that can lead to heat illness, Chu said.


“All workers should benefit from safe conditions whenever they work outside in the heat no matter where they are,” she said.

Locally, the issue of working in extreme heat gained attention recently after U.S. postal carrier Peggy Frank, 63, was found dead July 6 in her mail truck on a 117-degree day in Woodland Hills. Authorities, including OSHA, are probing whether heat was a factor.


Employers are obligated to protect employees from any hazardous condition, including potential heat stress, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.


In the case of the U.S. Postal Service, carriers are reminded daily to stay hydrated throughout their route, wear appropriate clothing, such as hats, and get into the shade whenever and as much as possible, officials said.


In 2005, after a series of farmworker deaths, California became the first state in the country to issue comprehensive heat standard protections for workers. Those regulations were strengthened a decade later and have likely saved lives, activists and experts say.


While there have been some tragic cases of heat-related deaths in the state since then, Chu said it’s probably related to enforcement of the state’s regulations.


“We feel it’s related to whether there are people being sent out to see whether employers are really doing their job and whether they are holding them accountable,” she said.


Chu added that she’s hopeful that the new legislation will tackle this problem.

That sentiment was echoed by Widess, the former Cal/Osha chief, who said that even in a state like California, it’s important to increase enforcement capacity of regulatory agencies.


“More inspectors are needed to make sure employers are doing right by workers, taking every step needed, and OSHA is chronically understaffed nationally,” she said.

Sycamore Hills Plaza continues filling out.


Two more eateries — Corky’s Kitchen & Bakery and WaBa Grill — opened recently in the center, which straddles the Claremont/Upland border and is anchored by CVS Pharmacy and Whole Foods Market 365.

Corky’s and WaBa Grill join the previously opened Starbucks, MOD Pizza and SpireWorks Modern Döner, as well as Picnik and The Bar and Noodle, which are located inside Whole Foods.


Also slated to open at the center are Jersey Mike’s Subs, Dog Haus Biergarten, Wendy’s and Menchie’s Frozen Yogurt.


Sycamore Hills Plaza is on the north side of Base Line, just east of the 210 Freeway.


Dollar deals


McDonald’s fans, if you haven’t yet downloaded the chain’s mobile app, now is a good time to do so.


The app features weekly deals and the chain recently pushed some longer-term deep discounts that are worth taking advantage of.


Through the app, guests can purchase any sandwich — with the exception of a Signature Crafted sandwich or a double Quarter Pounder with Cheese — for just $1.


The deal is good once daily through Sept. 30.


Also available is a deal allowing the purchase of any size McCafé beverage for $1, which is valid once daily through Dec. 30.


Sorry, Starbucks.


Other long-term deals available through the app include:

  * $1 McDouble sandwich (valid once daily through Dec. 30)
  * $3 off a $10 purchase (valid once daily through Dec. 30)
  * 20-piece McNuggets for $4.99 (valid once daily through Dec. 30)
  * Buy one McCafé beverage (excluding drip and iced coffee), get one for one cent (valid once daily through Sept. 30)
  * Free hash browns with the purchase of any breakfast sandwich (valid once daily through Aug. 19)

These deals are in addition to the chain’s weekly deals, which in recent weeks have included a buy-one-get-one deal (either free or for $1) on Quarter Pounder with Cheese burgers.


The McDonald’s app, which also allows mobile ordering, is available for Android and iOS.


Free phone from Farmer Boys


Another app-related deal is being advertised by Farmer Boys.


The chain is offering a free Android smartphone with the purchase of two months of service for $100.


To begin the process, simply download the chain’s Very Important Farmer Loyalty Club app on Android or iOS or sign up by visiting www.farmerboys.com/vif.


The app allows guests to earn free food by scanning their receipts when they visit. New members also receive a $5 credit just for signing up.


Also, the chain is giving a bonus $8 credit for guests who visit three times in July and spend at least $5 each visit.


Details on the app and the free phone offer can be found at www.farmerboys.com/promotions.


Beer and bites for charity


Barons Market has announced its latest Backroom Beer Pairing, which is set for Wednesday, July 25.


The partner brewery for this month’s event is San Diego-based Thorn Brewing Company.


The event runs from 6 to 8 p.m.


The menu will consist of:

  * Rock the Pale Ale paired with Spicy Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps
  * Hopster Pot paired with Summer Shrimp Ceviche
  * Barrio Lager paired with Sausage, Pepper & Onions Rolls
  * Relay IPA paired with Carrot Cheese Cake

Tickets are $15. Ticket sales from the markets’ Riverside County stores (Temecula, Wildomar and Murrieta) will benefit Feeding America Riverside | San Bernardino, while sales from its San Diego-area stores will benefit Feeding San Diego.


Visit the Beer Goggles blog (www.insidesocal.com/beer) for a link to purchase tickets.


Birthday burger deal


Ruby’s Diner is celebrating its namesake’s birthday with a special burger and fries deal.


From 11:30 a.m. to close on Wednesday, July 25, guests can purchase a birthday burger and fries for just $2.99.


The deal is available at select locations. The chain’s Inland Empire locations, at 4900 Seminole Drive, Cabazon, and 155 S. Palm Canyon Drive, Palm Springs, are both participating.

Through the app, guests can purchase any sandwich — with the exception of a Signature Crafted sandwich or a double Quarter Pounder with Cheese — for just $1.


The deal is good once daily through Sept. 30.


Also available is a deal allowing the purchase of any size McCafé beverage for $1, which is valid once daily through Dec. 30.

  * Free hash browns with the purchase of any breakfast sandwich (valid once daily through Aug. 19)

These deals are in addition to the chain’s weekly deals, which in recent weeks have included a buy-one-get-one deal (either free or for $1) on Quarter Pounder with Cheese burgers.


The McDonald’s app, which also allows mobile ordering, is available for Android and iOS.


Free phone from Farmer Boys

The app allows guests to earn free food by scanning their receipts when they visit. New members also receive a $5 credit just for signing up.


Also, the chain is giving a bonus $8 credit for guests who visit three times in July and spend at least $5 each visit.

Anyone who hasn’t been to Anaheim’s Downtown Disney recently may be startled by the sweeping changes they’ll find, including shuttered restaurants and businesses that make the west end of the district resemble a failed mall.


The closures are only temporary, though, as the closed businesses along the western edge of the retail and dining district, including the Rainforest Cafe, ESPN Zone, Earl of Sandwich and the AMC Theatres will eventually be hidden by construction walls and then demolished to make way for a posh new hotel slated to open in 2021. It will be built on 17 acres comprising the west side of the outdoor mall to the border of the existing Disneyland Hotel.


Other buildings are also vacant, as they are being remodeled to make way for new venues. In the mall’s center, the shuttered building that formerly contained the Build-a-Bear and RideMakerz shops is undergoing renovations from kid-friendly shops into new dining-and-drinking spots emphasizing craft beer including Ballast Point, a microbrewery out of San Diego and Black Tap Craft Burgers & Beer.


This is the first comprehensive overhaul of the property since it opened in January 2001. Downtown Disney originally developed as part of a massive project that included the creation of Disney California Adventure theme park from the former Disneyland parking lot and one of the largest parking garages in the nation. The district was designed to link Disney California Adventure with the existing Disneyland and capture extra tourist dollars on site, rather than letting them slip away to other businesses along Harbor Boulevard.


When it first opened, the district was also popular with locals looking for Disney-themed shopping, dining, seeing a movie at the AMC Theatres and maybe even watching the Disneyland fireworks from outside the park.


But the parking lot set aside specifically for Downtown Disney visitors became so overcrowded that parking validation policies were tightened, making it costly for locals to use the space as an outdoor mall without spending money. Nowadays, many users believe that Disney officials want to court out-of-town visitors who will open their wallets wider, catering to them with the new hotel and other businesses that serve travelers.


“It seems like they’re trying to get more dollars spent per head as opposed to people like me, who will just walk around and buy a churro and eat occasionally,” Disney fan and annual passholder Roger Yamashita said. “I’ve been to every Disney park in the world and it seems like they are trying to adopt more of a Walt Disney World model, to make it for a vacation destination.”


In the past, Yamashita, who lives in Yorba Linda, said he and his friends would drop by after work or on a Sunday afternoon to enjoy the frequent live music, go to ESPN Zone or eat at Naples Ristorante. “I imagine I’ll still be going, but not as often.”


Yamashita cited the closure of the most affordable restaurant at Downtown Disney – the popular Earl of Sandwich – as another way that locals will be discouraged from visiting the district.


Locals who patronized the former House of Blues music venue have also moved over to the nearby Anaheim GardenWalk mall, since it was replaced by bowling-drinking-and-dining venue Splitsville.


Disneyland spokeswoman Liz Jaeger declined to discuss any particular plan behind the renovations, except to say that the many changes will result in “a fresh, one-of-a-kind Disney experience, providing guests of all ages a mix of family-friendly dining, shopping and entertainment.”


Soon, people seeking to park their cars at the Downtown Disney will be diverted to a new location, while heavy equipment will move in to begin construction of the new 700-room hotel, expected to open in 2021. Its ground floor will house restaurants and shops, and Disney fans are hoping places like the Earl of Sandwich will relocate there. For now, though, parking and security entrances will remain the same at least until some time in August.


The as-yet-unnamed hotel will cater to upscale guests and will feature the chance to board the monorail inside the structure. Disneyland Resort currently has three hotel properties in Anaheim: The Disneyland Hotel, Disney’s Grand Californian and Disney’s Paradise Pier. A master plan shows how they would all be linked after the area is redeveloped.

Disney’s plans for the hotel are still being reviewed by the city of Anaheim and likely to go before the Planning Commission for approval later this summer, city spokeswoman Lauren Gold said. Until it’s approved, no specific timeline has been made public for construction to begin.


“Over the next several months, several fresh dining concepts include Ballast Point, Black Tap Craft Burgers & Shakes and Salt & Straw, will open at Downtown Disney District, which will give the destination a new robust blend of eateries,” Disney’s Jaeger said in a prepared statement. “Recent additions such as The VOID, Splitsville Luxury Lanes and Disney Home are already giving our guests new ways to experience the Disneyland Resort.”

The women who spoke out against the abuse by Larry Nassar stood together Wednesday night in a powerful and solemn closing to the show highlighting the past year’s top athletes and moments in sports.


Gymnast Aly Raisman, softball player Tiffany Thomas Lopez and gymnast Sarah Klein, who said she was Nassar’s first victim 30 years ago, took turns speaking. Klein chided the U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State for placing “money and medals above the safety of child athletes.”


Olympic snowboarding champion Chloe Kim won a leading three ESPYs, including best female athlete, while Alex Ovechkin claimed best male athlete.


Kim had tears in her eyes as she listened to the Arthur Ashe recipients.


“We must start caring about children’s safety more than we care about adults’ reputations,” Klein said. “If we can just give one person the courage to use their voice, this is worth it.”


Raisman added, “For too long we were ignored. It could have been avoided. All we needed was one adult to have the integrity to stand between us and Larry Nassar.”


“To all the survivors out there, don't let anyone rewrite your story. Your truth does matter. You matter. And you are not alone.”

The audience gave the group a prolonged standing ovation and remained on its feet while the women spoke.


“What a powerful stage up here,” host Danica Patrick said before signing off.


Ovechkin joined Roger Federer and Olympic snowboarder Shaun White as double winners. Ovechkin was in Russia with his wife, Nastya, who is 8½ months pregnant.Newly retired racecar driver Patrick became the first woman to host the show at the Microsoft Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Her opening monologue mostly fell flat, with athletes sitting stone-faced or wincing at many of the jokes.


Kim took female athlete honors over Olympic skier Mikaela Shiffrin, WNBA player Sylvia Fowles and soccer player Julie Ertz.


“This year has been filled with so many incredible memories I will hold onto the rest of my life,” Kim said as she held the silver trophy. “I really want to thank my family. They’ve sacrificed so much for me.”


Kim also claimed trophies for best female Olympian and female action sports athlete. At the Pyeongchang Games in February, she became the youngest to win a snowboarding medal when the then-17-year-old claimed gold in halfpipe.


Ovechkin, who led the Washington Capitals to their first Stanley Cup championship, also won for best NHL player. He beat out Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and fellow first-time nominees Jose Altuve of the Houston Astros and James Harden of the Houston Rockets for male athlete.


Federer’s five-set victory at the Australian Open in January for his 20th Grand Slam singles title earned honors for record-breaking performance and he also received best male tennis player.


White won best Olympic moment with his final-run performance in South Korea featuring back-to-back 1440s to take gold, and best male Olympian.

Let’s politely say the conclusions varied.


So who’s correct? Who do you trust? Retirement choices are no small matter.


Let me take a literal middle ground by considering their collective wisdom. As a public service, my trusty spreadsheet helped me combine this trio of retirement location rankings to give a better picture of the varying strengths vs. weaknesses of the states.


I reassembled their published ranking data — overall scores, subindex grades and related data — into three evenly weighted metrics: costs (buying power); character (culture and climate); and care (healthcare and healthiness). What did I learn?


Florida is the place to retire, statistically speaking to my composite index. It ranked No. 1 for costs and character. But if you don’t care for humidity, and enjoy winter’s chill, No. 2 was South Dakota, which enjoyed No. 4 grades for costs and care.


Third-ranked was New Hampshire (No. 4 for character; 10th-best for care), then Virginia: (ninth-best for character) and Hawaii (No. 40 for costs but No. 1 for care!)


Conversely, don’t think about Louisiana for your golden years, according to my math. It ranked last in my reassembled scorecard. Why? No. 49 for character and No. 50 for care.


Next worst score was Arkansas (No. 47 for character), then came Kentucky (No. 47 for care); New Mexico (No. 46 for character) and Illinois (No. 41 for care).


What about California? By my math, the Golden State ranked a middle-of-the-pack 26th for one’s golden years. California’s seventh-worst ranking for costs was improved by a No. 16 grade for character and No. 18 for care.


Here is how the 50 states ranked as retirement options in order of my overall scoring then broken down by ranking for cost, character and care quality.

In year’s past it’s been a limited edition Funko Pop, a special print from that one show or an enamel pin. This year, the thing that many people were itching to take home with them wasn’t on the convention center floor but in the bathrooms.

Con-goers making a quite pit stop were pleasantly surprised by toilet seat covers emblazoned with the face of Deadpool and the message, “This is all Fox could afford. Deadpool 2 dropping soon on Blu-ray and digital.”


The seat covers were so popular, fans could be seen grabbing them by the handful and stuffing them into their complimentary SDCC bags.


One convention center worker said she’d been replacing the protective tissue paper much more frequently than years past.


Photos of the covers began to show up on social media celebrating Fox’s ingenious marketing ploy.

As with most Comic-Con exclusives, this one ended up on eBay only hours after the convention floor opened on the Wednesday, July 18, for Preview Night.


One enterpeneur wanted $60, plus shipping and handling, for a cover signed by Deadpool co-creator, Rob Liefeld. Most however ran on average for about $15 to $20 a pop.


I’m deluged with this!! Signing these left and right on the street corner!!! https://t.co/WqR9jFM87N

It’s unclear if the San Diego Convention Center was provided with enough seat covers to last the length of SDCC, but some women coming out of one of the bathrooms on preview night commented many of the stalls were without the coveted covers.


The first night of Comic-Con will officially kick off Thursday, July 19, and will run until Sunday, July 22.

Riverside County Department of Animal Services spokesman John Welsh said the feral donkey was wounded over the weekend, and a concerned resident posted images of the animal to social media, catching the attention of authorities.


Welsh described the attack on the burro as a “terrible act of cruelty” that left the animal in need of veterinary care.


The burro was spotted in the Reche Canyon area, in the vicinity of the Black Stallion Ranch, north of Moreno Valley, and animal control officers went to the location Wednesday afternoon, Welsh said.


“We shot it with two tranquilizer darts, but efforts to capture the wild burro were unsuccessful,” Welsh said. “The darts should have been enough, and we are uncertain why they were not effective.


“It could have been a result of the animal being worked up earlier, prior to our arrival,” he said.


The arrow was no longer protruding from the creature when the darts were injected, but the wound was still visible, according to Welsh


Officers will return to the area Thursday morning to have another go at corralling the burro.


Welsh said the nonprofit DonkeyLand rescue organization has been alerted and will be enlisted to assist.


Officials asked anyone with information regarding who might have injured the donkey to contact the Department of Animal Services at (951) 358-7387.


Herds of wild burros populate the Pigeon Pass and Reche Canyon areas between Moreno Valley and Colton. Riverside County Ordinance No. 934 makes it unlawful to feed, pet or otherwise draw the donkeys toward roadsides and other locations where they might be hurt — or wander into traffic and cause accidents.

The two-bedroom, three-bathroom house in the 11200 block of Dilling Street, adjacent to the Los Angeles River, is listed for $1.885 million, according to Ernie Carswell, a Douglas Elliman agent who is listing what he said “is reportedly the second most photographed home in the United States after the White House.”


The home’s interior does not match what was shown in the 1969-74 ABC series because those scenes were filmed at Paramount Studios, Carswell told the Los Angeles Times.


Several homes in the neighborhood have been demolished recently. The owners will give first consideration to bidders who want to keep the home intact, Carswell told The Times.


“We’re not going to accept the first big offer from a developer who wants to tear it down,” Carswell told The Times. “We’re going to wait a few days, in case there are others who want to purchase it as an investment to preserve it.”

Bracken Blucher pleaded guilty in May to manufacturing illegal drugs, causing a fire that resulted in property damage and a sentence-enhancing allegation of causing damage to multiple structures in a fire.


A home in the 33000 block of East Harvest Way in Wildomar was destroyed early Wednesday, July 19, 2017, in an explosion and fire that also sent one person to the hospital and damaged a neighboring house. Sheriff’s officials were investigating whether an illegal drug lab producing “honey oil” was to blame. (Photo by Frank Bellino, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG)

A Riverside County Superior Court judge certified the plea terms and imposed the sentence recommended by the Department of Probation.


The judge additionally ordered Blucher to pay victim restitution in an amount that will be determined by the agency.


Blucher was in the process of making a marijuana derivative known as “honey oil” in the predawn hours of July 19, 2017, when his residence erupted in flames from a butane gas explosion.


The blaze on Harvest Way, near Cornstalk Road, was reported at 4 a.m.


According to county fire officials, a 1,200-square foot modular home was consumed by the conflagration, and a neighboring single-story residence was moderately damaged.


Blucher suffered minor to moderate burns that required emergency treatment.


Investigators found butane gas cannisters scattered throughout the street and yard fronting the property where the fire started.

Seven engine crews and a truck company, numbering about 30 personnel, spent nearly an hour battling the flames before they were fully contained.


Three people living in the modular home with Blucher were displaced. Three adults and a child from the neighboring property required temporary lodgings.


Ironically, the blaze occurred one day after the District Attorney’s Office released a series of public service announcements warning of the perils of butane honey oil production.


The videos featured Alex Gonzales and his girlfriend Selina Cervantes, both of whom were severely burned in a butane honey oil blaze at a Palm Springs motel in February 2015. Cervantes suffered second- and third-degree burns to 97 percent of her body and was permanently disfigured.


“People need to understand that the butane honey oil extraction process takes lives — it hurts people forever,” District Attorney Mike Hestrin said before unveiling the public service announcements. “We want to put an end to the manufacture of butane honey oil.”Drug lab operators use butane to extract tincture from cannabis plants. The product, often referred to as “wax” or hash, can be mixed with anything and bottled.


Butane honey oil labs have sprung up in both remote and heavily populated areas of the county. In the past few years, butane honey oil fires have erupted in Cathedral City, Moreno Valley, Murrieta, Norco and Riverside.

Spokeswoman Amy Phillips at Fort Hunter Liggett says the wind from the rotors of a helicopter that was landing blew over the tent about 9:30 p.m. Wednesday.


Phillips says there were 22 injuries, most of them minor. She says four people were taken to hospitals. Earlier reports said up to 30 people were injured.


Fort Hunter Liggett is in Monterey County, about 170 miles south of San Francisco. The sprawling base is the largest U.S. Army Reserve Command post.


It’s currently holding an annual training exercise for thousands of Army, Navy, Air Force, Army National Guard, Army Reserve and Canadian Armed Forces troops.

OPINION
The editorial board and opinion section staff are independent from the news-gathering side of our organization. The editorials are unsigned because, while written by one or more members of our staff, they represent the point of view of our news organization’s management. Read more about what we do and who we are.


Opinion Editor
Scott Kaufman, 714-796-5025, skaufman@scng.com


How to submit a letter to the editor
We welcome letters to the editor on all issues of public concern. All submissions are subject to editing and condensation, and they can be published only with the writer’s true name. Letters must include the writer’s home community and a daytime phone number for confirmation. Please limit submissions to 150 words and send via email (without attachments) to opinion@scng.com.


How to submit a guest commentary
Southern California News Group newspapers consider guest commentary submissions of no more than 600 words.


We look for topical commentary on public policy and social issues that are of general interest to our print and digital readership. We give preference to local, regional and California topics and writers.


The commentary must be the author’s original work. We do not pay for guest commentaries.


Submissions are subject to editing, though we make every effort to retain the author’s voice and point of view. Email your submission to opinion@scng.com with the subject line “Op-ed submission.” Include a sentence or two at the end including your position, city or community of residence, and any background relevant to your expertise in the topic.

About Southern California News Group


Groundbreaking


Established in March 2016, the Southern California News Group (SCNG) has virtually overnight become one of the most powerful and influential news organizations in the U.S. This dynamic union was created when the Los Angeles News Group (owners of nine local daily newspapers and websites) and its parent company Digital First Media (DFM) acquired Freedom Communications (owners of the Orange County Register and Riverside Press-Enterprise).


By combining these two highly regarded and well-established institutions, SCNG has emerged as the largest news content provider in the five-county Los Angeles metropolitan area. As a leader in circulation among top publications nationwide, SCNG now owns and operates 11 local daily newspapers and more than a dozen community weeklies.


Our mission is to connect communities by providing readers with the area's best local news coverage, while providing advertisers with unprecedented access to one of the world's most diverse and dynamic audiences.


No matter the distribution vehicle—newspaper, magazine, mobile, online—SCNG's in-depth reporting on local news, politics, sports and entertainment continues to attract a desirable audience for its customers. Combining print, online and social media, SCNG now delivers premium content to over 8.1 million adults every week, making it an indispensable marketing solution for advertisers across Southern California.

Share Your News with the Redlands Daily Facts


WHAT TO SEND?

  * Local stories — people, places and events — that are unique to Redlands.
  * Club news about meetings, activities, special events and election of officers sponsored by civic, service, fraternal and social organizations.
  * Business news of new enterprises in town, promotions, news employees, changes in hours, services and products.
  * Church news and news of related organizations.
  * School news of student activities, parent-teacher group meetings, school concerts, plays and other events like college honors, graduations, athletics and plays.
  * Sports news about games, team registrations, tournaments and other activities.
  * Programs at parks and libraries, along with other facilities available to the public.
  * Entertainment venues, special events, family activities and other amusements.

WRITING A NEWS RELEASE

  * All news releases should contain the organization’s name and address, along with the name and daytime phone number of the individual to be contacted in case more information is needed.
  * Consider sending an electronic press release via email. Paste the text into the message field rather than sending an attachment that may not be compatible with the programs in use at the Daily Facts.
  * Be concise. News releases, as a rule, should not be longer than 1½ pages, double-spaced.
  * Be aware of submission deadlines. Most publications like material at least two weeks before the event. It can never get there too early.

BREAKING NEWS


When speed is of the essence, contact our city desk at 909-259-9318. Other press releases should be e-mailed to editor@inlandnewspapers.com. If requesting coverage of an event, be sure to contact us at least a week in advance.


LOCAL NEWS


For news story consideration, please send information at least two weeks in advance to editor@inlandnewspapers.com.

PHOTO


Do you have photos from a community event? Or is there an upcoming event you’d like to see covered visually? Send the details our way. For event coverage, let us know at least two weeks in advance and keep in mind we’re looking for photo opportunities that are not set up just for us. Action is the key.

SPORTS


We encourage coaches to send us varsity game results only. Deadline for the high school game results is 9 p.m. on the day of the event, but earlier calls are appreciated. E-mail ed.castro@langnews.com, or call 909-259-9320 to report scores.

Our Business section includes announcements of new businesses and products; deals, mergers and transactions; changes to existing companies; promotions, new hirings and retirements.

OPINION


HOW TO SUBMIT A GUEST COMMENTARY


Southern California News Group newspapers consider guest commentary submissions of no more than 600 words.


We look for topical commentary on public policy and social issues that are of general interest to our print and digital readership. We give preference to local, regional and California topics and writers.


The commentary must be the author’s original work. We do not pay for guest commentaries.


Submissions are subject to editing, though we make every effort to retain the author’s voice and point of view. Email your submission to opinion@scng.com with the subject line “Op-ed submission.” Include a sentence or two at the end including your position, city or community of residence, and any background relevant to your expertise in the topic.


HOW TO SUBMIT A LETTER TO THE EDITOR


We welcome letters to the editor on all issues of public concern. All submissions are subject to editing and condensation, and they can be published only with the writer’s true name. Letters must include the writer’s home community and a daytime phone number for confirmation. Please limit submissions to 150 words and send via email (without attachments) to opinion@scng.com.

Privacy Policy


Privacy Policy


PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES PERIODICALLY AND IS EFFECTIVE AS OF MAY 25, 2018.


Digital First Media (“Digital First Media,” “us,” or “we”) is committed to protecting your personal privacy. We provide this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to explain the type of Personal Information (as defined below) we collect on web sites including SMS/Text Alerts and Mobile Web owned by the Digital First Media, such as www.digitalfirstmedia.com (each, a “Web Site”), and our mobile application (the “Application,” together with Web Site, the “Platform”) and how we use Personal Information. As we update and expand our Platform and services, our Policy may change so check back to this page from time to time.


Our Policy applies to Personal Information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, through our Platform, or in other ways such as by phone, by mail, or through other offline and print media. This Policy does not apply to Personal Information collected about you by anyone except us and only applies to the Platform or Web Site to which this Policy is linked.


Types of Information We Collect


In order to make your visits to our Platform and use of the services available on or through our Platform as worthwhile as possible, we may ask you for Personal Information. “Personal Information” is information that allows someone to identify or contact you. We also may collect certain information from your computer each time you visit us that is not Personal Information. For example, non-user specific aggregated data such as information about traffic patterns on the Web Sites.


What Information is Collected on Our Platform


Information You Provide. We collect Personal Information when you provide it to us on our Platform. Such Personal Information may be collected, for example, when you submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on our Platform, send us an e-mail, sign up for an email newsletter or mobile alerts, or in any other way submit information to us via our Platform.


You may be able to send products, services, or information to others through our Platform by clicking on an “E-mail to Friend” or similar button on our Platform or in an e-mail that we have sent you. In some of these cases (unless you simply forward our e-mail on your own), you may provide the name and e-mail address of your friend or family member to us. Such Personal Information will be treated in accordance with our Policy and applicable law.


Cookies. We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser when you visit a site that are stored on your device. Cookies improve and personalize your experience on our Web Sites. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our Policy. Some web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Refusing a cookie may negatively impact the display or function of the Web Site. Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you not be “tracked” online. At this time, Digital First Media does not modify your experience based upon whether such a signal is broadcast.


Clear GIFs. We may use clear GIFs (a/k/a “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies on our Web Site and in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a Web Page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message.


Network and Internet Information. Our server may automatically collect data about your server’s internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol Address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your internet service provider whenever you’re on the internet. We may also collect the referring page that linked you to us or the next site you visit; how you use or interact with our Web Site; technical information and specifications about your browser, device, software and settings; any search terms you have entered on our Web Site or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers.


How is Information Used


We use both Personal Information and non-personal information for multiple purposes, including:

  * Improving or customizing the Web Site;
  * Providing updates;
  * Sending newsletters, promotional offers or opportunities regarding new services, products or events, and third-party products or services, including advertisements;
  * Responding to your requests including providing you with our product and service offerings;
  * Internal record keeping;
  * Reporting Personal Information about your account to credit bureaus (such as late or payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report);
  * Communicating with you about, and administering your participation in, promotions, surveys and market research;
  * Operating, evaluating, and improving our business;
  * Diagnosing problems with our Platform, administering our Platform, and enhancing the Platform;
  * Monitoring the usage and performance of our Platform;
  * Improving and analyzing our products and services;
  * Managing our communications; and
  * To protect against fraud and identity theft and comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards and our policies, including our Terms of Use.

Sharing of Your Personal Information

The use of such integrated tools enables you to share Personal Information about yourself with other individuals or the public through the social networking site, but is not governed by this Policy. For more information about the privacy practices those social networking sites, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these social networking sites.


Third Party Offers. We may, from time to time, provide your Personal Information to third parties so that they may send you these offers.

In addition, we also do not manage the unsubscribe process for various third party entities and Digital First Media affiliates. You should contact the respective Digital First Media affiliate or the third party entity for more information relating to their unsubscribe process or correction or removal of your Personal information.

Disclosures Without Your Consent. We may disclose Personal Information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws. We may also share your Personal Information in order to establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, or a violation of our policies, or to comply with your request for the shipment of products to or the provision of services by a third party intermediary.

These companies may use Personal Information (generally, not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to this Platform and to other web sites in order to provide advertisements. These companies may employ cookies and clear GIFs to measure advertising effectiveness. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these third party ad servers. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having Personal Information used by these companies, see the Network Advertising Initiative’s consumer web site at www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/. Digital First Media participates in behavioral based advertising.

Your Rights


Objection and Opt-Out. Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to “opt-out” or object to certain of our uses of your Personal Information at any point.

You may also opt-out of promotional e-mails by clicking on an opt-out link within the e-mail you received. In some cases, we may no longer be able to provide you services if you opt-out of certain necessary processing.


Changing Your Personal Information. You may request your Personal Information be updated or changed. Some of our Web Sites may allow you to do so directly. Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law.


Deletion. Digital First Media generally keeps your Personal Information for as long as is required for the purpose it is collected, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. You may, however, request that we delete your Personal Information. We may also decide to delete your Personal Information if we believe it is inaccurate, incomplete, or that our continued use or storage of the information is prohibited by our obligations to other parties. When we delete Personal Information it will be removed from active databases but may remain in archives where it is not practical or possible to delete it. In addition, we may keep your Personal Information as needed to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements.

Protecting Information


No transmission of data over the internet or electronic storage of data is completely secure. Digital First Media takes reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal Information provided to this Platform, but we cannot guarantee that Personal Information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.


In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information may have been compromised, we may notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and we may notify you by any method permitted by law.


Children


Digital First Media does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. No one under age 13 is authorized to provide any Personal Information to us or use our Platform.


Third Party “Linked-To” Web Sites


When you are on our Platform you may have the opportunity to visit, or link to, other web sites not operated by Digital First Media, including other web sites operated by our affiliates, by service vendors, or by unaffiliated third parties. These web sites may collect Personal Information about you. Digital First Media does not control web sites that are operated by these entities and is not responsible for the information practices of these web sites. The privacy policies of web sites operated by other affiliates of Digital First Media are located on those web sites.


Applicant and Employee Information


If you submit an application for employment to or are currently an employee of Digital First Media, Digital First Media collects your Personal Information through your application for employment or during continued employment with Digital First Media, and your submission of employee related documents (collectively “Employee Information”). Examples of Employee Information that may be collected in connection with your employment or application for employment include your name, date of birth, government issued identification, banking information, marital status, health information, benefit information, employment history, education, job qualifications, and other relevant employee personal data. We also collect some of this information about your dependents when you provide it to us when you enroll in health and other benefits or provide contact information. By providing Personal Information about family members or other individuals, you represent that you have their consent to provide this information to us for the purposes set forth in this Policy. Employee Information does not include any Personal Information that is available to the general public and excludes information generally available on a business card.


In accordance with applicable law, Digital First Media may use Employee Information to evaluate applications for employment, manage work-related aspects of the employee-employer relationship (i.e., training, payroll, benefits, travel, reimbursement expenses, performance appraisals, succession planning, team member health and safety), investigate and respond to any claims related to your employment, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Your Employee Information will not be used for direct marketing purposes by us or any third party service provider, unless you specifically consent to such use.


Digital First Media shares your Employee Information with third parties who provide outsourced human resource functions to us. Digital First Media may disclose your Employee Information if required or permitted to do so by law (such as when part of a governmental agency action or litigation), governmental or quasi-governmental requests, or a regulatory organization, or to relevant third parties such as site technicians, brokers, auditors, lawyers, or professional advisors. In the event that Digital First Media considers it necessary or where required by law to disclose Employee Information, we may share your Employee Information with our outside lawyers, law enforcement, or others who are legally authorized. As Digital First Media continues to develop our business, we may buy or sell assets. In the event that Digital First Media or substantially all of our assets are acquired, Employee Information may be one of the transferred assets.

Digital First Media reserves the right to change or update this Policy, or any other of their policies or practices, at any time, and will notify users of this Platform by posting such changed or updated Policy on this page. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to this Platform.

Digital First Media Cookie Policy


Last Updated May 16, 2018


This Cookie Policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies. This Cookie Policy applies to any website that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. For more information on our privacy practices generally please visit our Privacy Policy.


We may change this Cookie Policy at any time. Please take a look at the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last revised. Any changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on or through the Site. Please note that the names and functionality of cookies, pixels and other technologies may change over time.

What is a cookie?


A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables a variety of features and functionality. Cookies also enable you to easily share content and help us serve relevant ads to you. Cookies can do this because websites can read and write them, enabling websites to recognize you and remember important information that will make your use of a website more convenient (for example by remembering preference settings).


Does Digital First Media use cookies?


Yes. We use cookies and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses our websites has the best possible experience and for marketing purposes. Cookies also help us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit our site or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this policy.


When do we place cookies?


We place cookies when you visit our websites or use certain mobile applications. Any web browser visiting these sites will receive cookies from us. We also place cookies in your browser when you visit non Digital First Media sites that host our plugins or tags.


What types of cookies do we use?


We use a variety of cookie types:


  * Preference Cookies.Preference cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember language or other local settings and customize the websites accordingly.

  * Strictly Necessary Cookies.Strictly necessary cookies are necessary for the website to work and to enable you to move around it and to use its features. Without these absolutely necessary cookies, websites will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like it to and we may not be able to provide the Site or certain services or features you request.
  * Social Plug-in Tracking Cookies.Such cookies are used to track members [and non-members] of social media networks for market research analytics, and product development.
  * Analytics Cookies.Analytics cookies collect information about your use of the websites, and enable us to improve the way they work. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on a website, help us record any difficulties you have with a website, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage, rather than the usage of a single person.
  * Advertising Cookies.Advertising cookies are used for marketing purposes. This is discussed below in greater detail.
  * Affiliate Cookies. Some of our websites may contain promotional links to other companies’ sites. If you follow one of these links or interact with that other site, a cookie is used to tell the other site that you came from one of our websites. That other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral. For more information, see the Internet Advertising Bureau’s guide about how affiliate marketing works.

All of the cookies above are either persistent cookies or session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to the website or interact with our services repeatedly. A persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by the website when you return to one of our websites or a partner site that uses our services. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).


What is Do Not Track (DNT)?


DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. No standard has been adopted to date. As such, we do not generally respond to “do not track” signals.


How are cookies used for advertising purposes?


Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They also help us provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. We may use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may employ cookies and clear GIFs to measure advertising effectiveness. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these third party advertising companies if you have any concerns. Note: Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Ads served by us may also set third party cookies.


Unless you clear these cookies from your browser, we may use this information to:

  * provide more relevant, interest-based advertising
  * provide aggregate reports of ads activity to advertisers and websites hosting the ads
  * help website and app owners understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps
  * detect and defend against fraud and other risks to protect users and partners
  * improve our products

Controlling cookies


Most browsers allow you to control and erase cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. Additionally, some features may work improperly or not at all. It may also stop you from saving customized settings. If you want to another way to clean out all cookies left behind by the websites you have visited, here are links where you can download programs that clean out cookies:

  * http://www.spybot.info/en/download/index.html,

We are not affiliated with any of the products provided above.


If you do not want to receive cookies, you can also change your browser settings on your computer or other device you’re using to access our services. If you use our sites without changing your browser settings, we’ll assume that you’re happy to receive all cookies.
