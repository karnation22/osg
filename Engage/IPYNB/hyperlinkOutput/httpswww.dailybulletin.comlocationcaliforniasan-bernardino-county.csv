The California Democratic Party handed Sen. Dianne Feinstein a striking rejection on Saturday, as party leaders endorsed her progressive challenger Kevin de León.


The endorsement, voted on by the state party’s executive board at a meeting in Oakland, gives De León a big morale boost as he faces an uphill race against the 26-year incumbent.


De León, a state senator from Los Angeles and the former leader of the state Senate, won 65 percent of the 333 delegates, according to the party. Feinstein netted 7 percent after urging her supporters to choose no endorsement “in the name of party unity.”


De León appealed to the party faithful by blasting President Donald Trump and embracing policies like single-payer health care and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, while tapping into discontentment with Feinstein among the party’s left flank.


“Today’s vote is a clear-eyed rejection of politics as usual in Washington, D.C.,” De León said in a statement. “The nation’s most accomplished Democratic Party is leading the call for a new generation of leadership who will fight to advance a bold agenda.”


Pro-De León activists erupted in cheers at Oakland’s Marriott City Center hotel as rumors leaked out about his victory Saturday evening.


“It shows that California Democrats expect strong progressive stances from our legislators,” said David Atkins, a delegate from Santa Barbara, between hugs with his fellow De León supporters. “We’re part of a movement in this party.”

Still, Feinstein remains a strong favorite for November — she won 44 percent in the June top-two primary to De León’s 12 percent, and has a sizable fundraising advantage.


“The reality here is that he got beat by over 30 points,” said Bill Carrick, Feinstein’s longtime strategist. “We should move on beyond the primary fights and try to win elections against Republicans.”


The endorsement means De León will be able to raise funds in coordination with the party and be featured in Democratic mailers. It will also likely net him a wave of national attention and donations.


Feinstein, who at 82 is the oldest current U.S. senator, had been calling in political favors in recent weeks to argue for a no endorsement vote. Her campaign sent a letter to executive board members from a half dozen of the party’s House candidates in key California seats asking leaders to abstain from supporting Feinstein or De León.


Neither Feinstein nor De León won the endorsement in the primary campaign at the Democratic convention in February, where De León got the support of 54 percent of the delegates — just under the 60 percent threshold necessary to win the endorsement.


De León’s endorsement coup echoes other wins for progressives in recent weeks, including New York candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who electrified liberals by defeating the number-four Democrat in the House of Representatives last month.


The contrast between the two candidates was on show as they rushed between caucus meetings on Saturday.


“Seniority matters,” Feinstein told her supporters over a breakfast of bacon and eggs, reminding them that she was the top Democrat on the Senate committee that will hold hearings on President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.


“This man will be the deciding vote on those things we hold most dear,” including the Roe v. Wade decision, she said. She said she and her committee would review “over one million pieces of paper” of Kavanaugh’s past opinions and other documents about his record, in an attempt to make a case against his nomination.


But De León argued that the hearings Feinstein is preparing for shouldn’t even take place.


“We need to shut the Senate down and never allow this individual to come to the Senate floor,” he declared to cheers at another caucus meeting later that morning. “What’s at stake is a generation of power, decisions that will affect each and every one of us.”


De León’s campaign argued that his connections with party activists will help him in the endorsement face-off, while Feinstein has invested less time in recent years engaging party activists.


“These are relationships he’s been building for 10 years or longer,” said Jonathan Underland, a De León spokesman, said this week. “The idea that he is trying to divide the party is just laughable.”


The Democrats walking the halls in Oakland are fired up over Trump and optimistic about their chances to take back the House in November. The most popular figure here has been Rep. Maxine Waters, who’s been attacked by the president after encouraging protests against him and his staffers. She won huge cheers when she declared Saturday that Trump was “embarrassing us every day.”

The Senate race remains the biggest sticking point, splitting Democrats over questions of liberal bona fides and generational leadership.


“You don’t need to replace someone who’s doing their job,” said labor rights organizer Dolores Huerta, who sat next to Feinstein at her breakfast. “Why do you want to go in there and divide the party?”

But De León’s backers said they were ready for a more progressive vision as the Golden State faces down the Trump administration. “I appreciate everything Dianne’s done for the state, but it’s time for some new blood and new values,” said David Weiner, a delegate from Palm Springs.


Feinstein has clashed with the state party faithful before, losing the Democratic endorsement in campaigns for governor and U.S. Senate in 1990 and 1992. In 1990, she dramatically declared her support for the death penalty at the state convention, over loud boos from the hall — and then her campaign cut an ad featuring the footage to show her independence.


In a sign of how Feinstein has moved to the left as she faces De León’s, she said earlier this year that she now opposes capital punishment.

“The folks who show up at Democratic executive board meetings have never been Dianne Feinstein’s base,” said Darry Sragow, a strategist who ran Feinstein’s 1990 campaign and isn’t working for either camp this year. “[De León] gaining the endorsement is not going to get him the votes he needs to win — but it’ll be an opportunity to put a point on the board when he has very few of those.”

Q. Honk, can I park on the street and block my own driveway? In my area, I get a lot of apartment and condo visitors parking on the street in front of my house. I put up with it, but it would be nice if they wouldn’t do it on Thanksgiving and Christmas. Those two days really bother me, especially when it is in regard to my immediate neighbors. What your mom once told you is right on: People should be courteous and, if possible, park in front of their friends’ homes when visiting.


– Jim Fuchs, Santa Ana


A. As tempting as it is, Jim, try not to park in front of your driveway.


Cpl. Anthony Bertagna, the spokesman for Santa Ana P.D., said that under the law you cannot park blocking even your own driveway.


“However, as with all tickets, it is at the discretion of the handling officer,” the good corporal said. “Often, if it is at the owner’s residence, they do not cite and just advise them of the law.”


That law, by the way, is from the Califoirnia Vehicle Code, so it covers the entire Golden State.


Q. Honk, the sign below a freeway on-ramp traffic-control light often reads, “One car per green.” Can I take the signage literally – one car per green? Let’s say I am the only car on the ramp and I see green, but it turns red again before I can get there. Can I just continue through without stopping?


– Susan Posilovich, Irvine


A. No.


The point of those ramp meters is to even out the flow of traffic on the freeway, so Honk gets your logic.


But the law is strict: You can only go on a green, even if there was no motorist before you on the ramp for 10 minutes. And the green is so short, don’t try rolling up to it and timing it.


Just stop and wait.


“You are going to treat it like any other red light,” said Duane Graham, an officer and spokesman for the California Highway Patrol out of the agency’s Westminster station house.


Susan, you are obviously asking about this because you want to do the right thing. Plenty of motorists, though, just blow through those red lights knowing they are breaking the law.


Nabbing such cheaters probably isn’t high on most CHP officers’ lists of biggest concerns. But there is a device out there to help them get those who don’t bother stopping when the meter lights are on.


On the backsides of a few ramp meters are lights that allow officers downstream to tell if the meter light is red or green. The cops, in their black-and-whites farther down the ramp pointed toward the freeway, can eyeball the driver and the light in their rear-view mirrors. When a violation occurs, they just drop behind the offenders and pull them over.


That device’s name? A tattletale light.


Honkin’ fact: When a 2-year-old boy died in a hot car in Sacramento over the weekend, it was the 57th time in California a child has died in a hot car since 1990, according to kidsandccars.org, an advocacy group. Each year, the organization says, an average of 37 children die in hot cars in the United States.

Fuller Theological Seminary has been quietly buying up property in downtown Pomona in anticipation of its move east from Pasadena in 2021.


Officials say they’d rather not talk about specific properties yet, since plans are still being formed and land bought. But the project area, known to be centered at Holt and Garey avenues, is becoming clearer based on records of real-estate transactions. More on that in a minute.

What caught my fancy was when someone at the Lassie House dedication tipped me off that Fuller had bought a former Bob’s Big Boy. (Bob’s appears to be a topic I can’t get away from.) The seller: Purpose Church.


I’m not sure which was more surprising: that a vacant Bob’s Big Boy was owned by the former First Baptist Church or that what may be the world’s best-known religious training school, which educates in 110 denominations, is buying it.


Are there theological implications behind Bob’s tripartite bun? Is 221 W. Holt Ave. considered holy ground?


Holy or not, Purpose Church was interested in the ground — specifically, the asphalt.


“We bought it about 10 years ago when it came on the market,” chief of operations Pamela Barden told me. “The interest was to preserve the parking.”


The lot’s 90 spaces have served as overflow parking for the church, which takes up the entire block immediately to the east. The restaurant ceased being a Bob’s in 1995 and the last tenant, a Chinese buffet, shut down about the same time the church bought the property.


As announced in May, Fuller intends to relocate in three years to Pomona, bringing 70 faculty, 150 administrative staff and 1,200 students. The 13-acre Pasadena campus, which gradually took over a mix of buildings as the school grew, has been put up for sale.


The goal, according to officials of the seminary founded in 1947, is to build a modern, more accessible campus in a city with lower housing costs for students.


In turn, Pomona will be able to tout the presence of a famous name alongside its signature institutions, among them Cal Poly Pomona, Fairplex and Casa Colina. (Not to mention Donahoo’s Chicken.)

Purchase price of the Bob’s property has not become public, but according to transaction records, Fuller has spent $6.6 million to buy four other properties in the vicinity, with escrow closing in May. Anchoring the package of buildings is the former Crocker Bank on the southwest corner of Holt and Garey, for which Fuller paid $2.55 million.


The two buildings immediately to the south along Garey to the corner of Center Street have been snapped up too: an arcade at 441 N. Garey Ave., once the Sunkist Theater, for $1.25 million and the office building at 411 N. Garey for $1.4 million.


The long 100 block of West Holt from Garey to Main Street, south side, consists of a half-dozen properties. One building in mid-block, 154 W. Holt, the former St. Charles Grill, has been bought for $1.4 million. A city-owned parking lot backs up to these properties to complete the square block.


Fuller spokesman Britt Vaughan said the school isn’t ready to disclose its purchases or its anticipated footprint. “Fairly soon the area will be public knowledge, but not necessarily what the spaces will be used for,” Vaughan told me by phone, explaining that a master plan is underway that will determine how best to use the space.


“Discussing exact locations at this point is premature from our point of view because purchases are not finalized. We want to be considerate to our Pomona partners and our new neighbors by giving careful thought to how we can integrate into the city over the next three years,” Vaughan wrote in a follow-up email.


While the other known purchases are within a square block, the Bob’s property is at Main Street on the north side of Holt. Maybe it’s an extra, like getting the burger-fries-soda combo but adding a side salad.


Escrow for the 1.1-acre property closed Tuesday, Barden said.


Under its bylaws, Purpose’s congregation had to approve the sale, which it did in a June 24 meeting. A 75 percent vote of those present was required. “We received a 98 percent affirmative vote,” Barden said.


Selling to a religious education institution must have appealed to the church and its congregants. Some church staffers attended Fuller and friendly discussions have taken place between the church and the seminary about the move.


As for what Fuller may do with the property, that’s unknown to Purpose. “We don’t know if they’re buying anything else in that block. We’re curious because it’s our new neighbors,” Barden said. “We’re pleased they’re going to make improvements in terms of some property that hasn’t been well-utilized.”

I’m fairly confident that like the church, the seminary is mainly interested in the restaurant for its land rather than its building. Although if they want to reopen it under the name Bob’s Fuller Boy, that would be awesome.

While we’re on the subject, Bob’s Big Boy had more of a presence here in its glory days than reflected in my May 16 column. Besides the locations in Alta Loma, Chino, Claremont, Diamond Bar, Ontario and Pomona that I cited, readers told me Covina had one, Pomona had a second one, on Foothill — later a Carrow’s and now Mr. D’s Diner — and Montclair had a Big Boy Jr. at the mall. He was a bigger boy than I knew.

Authorities Monday identified a 27-year-old man who authorities believe fatally stabbed a Cal Poly Pomona security officer before he was later shot and killed by police.


An autopsy was performed on the man, Rodney Lee Hunter, a Cal Poly Pomona custodian, officials said.


Hunter is suspected of killing Cal Poly Pomona Public Safety Specialist Mark Manlapaz, 37, of Victorville, about 4:30 p.m. on June 29 in the 3500 block of West Pomona Boulevard, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.


Hunter was killed in an officer-involved shooting that happened about 25 minutes later near University Road and Temple Avenue, according to the Sheriff’s Department.

Detectives have not determined a motive for the attack on Manlapaz, who had been a Claremont park ranger for three years and was a 16-year veteran of the Cal Poly Pomona Campus Security team.


A fellow employee found Manlapaz stabbed to death in his truck in a rural part of the campus, sheriff’s Lt. John Corina said.


A short time later, witnesses called police to report they might have located the suspect near Lyle Center, officials said.

The statistical geeks at WalletHub, Bankrate and Kiplinger’s recently took their respective shots at measuring how each state compares in terms of livability factors for your retirement years: from costs to culture to that critical aging issue, healthcare.


Let’s politely say the conclusions varied.


So who’s correct? Who do you trust? Retirement choices are no small matter.


Let me take a literal middle ground by considering their collective wisdom. As a public service, my trusty spreadsheet helped me combine this trio of retirement location rankings to give a better picture of the varying strengths vs. weaknesses of the states.


I reassembled their published ranking data — overall scores, subindex grades and related data — into three evenly weighted metrics: costs (buying power); character (culture and climate); and care (healthcare and healthiness). What did I learn?


Florida is the place to retire, statistically speaking to my composite index. It ranked No. 1 for costs and character. But if you don’t care for humidity, and enjoy winter’s chill, No. 2 was South Dakota, which enjoyed No. 4 grades for costs and care.


Third-ranked was New Hampshire (No. 4 for character; 10th-best for care), then Virginia: (ninth-best for character) and Hawaii (No. 40 for costs but No. 1 for care!)


Conversely, don’t think about Louisiana for your golden years, according to my math. It ranked last in my reassembled scorecard. Why? No. 49 for character and No. 50 for care.


Next worst score was Arkansas (No. 47 for character), then came Kentucky (No. 47 for care); New Mexico (No. 46 for character) and Illinois (No. 41 for care).


What about California? By my math, the Golden State ranked a middle-of-the-pack 26th for one’s golden years. California’s seventh-worst ranking for costs was improved by a No. 16 grade for character and No. 18 for care.


Here is how the 50 states ranked as retirement options in order of my overall scoring then broken down by ranking for cost, character and care quality.

Rank State          Cost Character Care
1    Florida        1    1         2   
2    South Dakota   4    20        1   
3    New Hampshire  22   4         3   
4    Virginia       18   9         6   
5    Hawaii         40   8         12  
6    Utah           7    33        4   
7    Montana        18   18        12

The statistical geeks at WalletHub, Bankrate and Kiplinger’s recently took their respective shots at measuring how each state compares in terms of livability factors for your retirement years: from costs to culture to that critical aging issue, healthcare.


Let’s politely say the conclusions varied.


So who’s correct? Who do you trust? Retirement choices are no small matter.


Let me take a literal middle ground by considering their collective wisdom. As a public service, my trusty spreadsheet helped me combine this trio of retirement location rankings to give a better picture of the varying strengths vs. weaknesses of the states.


I reassembled their published ranking data — overall scores, subindex grades and related data — into three evenly weighted metrics: costs (buying power); character (culture and climate); and care (healthcare and healthiness). What did I learn?


Florida is the place to retire, statistically speaking to my composite index. It ranked No. 1 for costs and character. But if you don’t care for humidity, and enjoy winter’s chill, No. 2 was South Dakota, which enjoyed No. 4 grades for costs and care.


Third-ranked was New Hampshire (No. 4 for character; 10th-best for care), then Virginia: (ninth-best for character) and Hawaii (No. 40 for costs but No. 1 for care!)


Conversely, don’t think about Louisiana for your golden years, according to my math. It ranked last in my reassembled scorecard. Why? No. 49 for character and No. 50 for care.


Next worst score was Arkansas (No. 47 for character), then came Kentucky (No. 47 for care); New Mexico (No. 46 for character) and Illinois (No. 41 for care).


What about California? By my math, the Golden State ranked a middle-of-the-pack 26th for one’s golden years. California’s seventh-worst ranking for costs was improved by a No. 16 grade for character and No. 18 for care.


Here is how the 50 states ranked as retirement options in order of my overall scoring then broken down by ranking for cost, character and care quality.

Rank State          Cost Character Care
1    Florida        1    1         2   
2    South Dakota   4    20        1   
3    New Hampshire  22   4         3   
4    Virginia       18   9         6   
5    Hawaii         40   8         12

The statistical geeks at WalletHub, Bankrate and Kiplinger’s recently took their respective shots at measuring how each state compares in terms of livability factors for your retirement years: from costs to culture to that critical aging issue, healthcare.


Let’s politely say the conclusions varied.


So who’s correct? Who do you trust? Retirement choices are no small matter.


Let me take a literal middle ground by considering their collective wisdom. As a public service, my trusty spreadsheet helped me combine this trio of retirement location rankings to give a better picture of the varying strengths vs. weaknesses of the states.


I reassembled their published ranking data — overall scores, subindex grades and related data — into three evenly weighted metrics: costs (buying power); character (culture and climate); and care (healthcare and healthiness). What did I learn?


Florida is the place to retire, statistically speaking to my composite index. It ranked No. 1 for costs and character. But if you don’t care for humidity, and enjoy winter’s chill, No. 2 was South Dakota, which enjoyed No. 4 grades for costs and care.


Third-ranked was New Hampshire (No. 4 for character; 10th-best for care), then Virginia: (ninth-best for character) and Hawaii (No. 40 for costs but No. 1 for care!)


Conversely, don’t think about Louisiana for your golden years, according to my math. It ranked last in my reassembled scorecard. Why? No. 49 for character and No. 50 for care.


Next worst score was Arkansas (No. 47 for character), then came Kentucky (No. 47 for care); New Mexico (No. 46 for character) and Illinois (No. 41 for care).


What about California? By my math, the Golden State ranked a middle-of-the-pack 26th for one’s golden years. California’s seventh-worst ranking for costs was improved by a No. 16 grade for character and No. 18 for care.


Here is how the 50 states ranked as retirement options in order of my overall scoring then broken down by ranking for cost, character and care quality.

Rank State          Cost Character Care
1    Florida        1    1         2   
2    South Dakota   4    20        1   
3    New Hampshire  22   4         3   
4    Virginia       18   9         6   
5    Hawaii         40   8         12  
6    Utah           7    33        4   
7    Montana        18   18        12  
8    Massachusetts  34   4         29  
9    Iowa           37   10        8

MORENO VALLEY — A wild burro was shot with an arrow, but eluded rescue efforts Wednesday.


Riverside County Department of Animal Services spokesman John Welsh said the feral donkey was wounded over the weekend, and a concerned resident posted images of the animal to social media, catching the attention of authorities.


Welsh described the attack on the burro as a “terrible act of cruelty” that left the animal in need of veterinary care.


The burro was spotted in the Reche Canyon area, in the vicinity of the Black Stallion Ranch, north of Moreno Valley, and animal control officers went to the location Wednesday afternoon, Welsh said.


“We shot it with two tranquilizer darts, but efforts to capture the wild burro were unsuccessful,” Welsh said. “The darts should have been enough, and we are uncertain why they were not effective.


“It could have been a result of the animal being worked up earlier, prior to our arrival,” he said.


The arrow was no longer protruding from the creature when the darts were injected, but the wound was still visible, according to Welsh


Officers will return to the area Thursday morning to have another go at corralling the burro.


Welsh said the nonprofit DonkeyLand rescue organization has been alerted and will be enlisted to assist.


Officials asked anyone with information regarding who might have injured the donkey to contact the Department of Animal Services at (951) 358-7387.


Herds of wild burros populate the Pigeon Pass and Reche Canyon areas between Moreno Valley and Colton. Riverside County Ordinance No. 934 makes it unlawful to feed, pet or otherwise draw the donkeys toward roadsides and other locations where they might be hurt — or wander into traffic and cause accidents.

A 49-year-old Ontario resident was arrested Wednesday, July 18, on suspicion of child molestation.


Ernesto Santos is believed to have molested a family member numerous times, an Ontario police news release said. He was arrested in the 1000 block of North Mountain Avenue on suspicion of lewd and lascivious acts with a child younger than 14. He is being held at West Valley Detention Center in lieu of $500,000 bail.


Investigators believe Santos may have sexually assaulted other children, the release said. They ask anyone with information to call Detective Dave Newland at 909-408-1898 or 909-986-6711, or report tips anonymously to We-Tip at 800-782-7463 or to its website at wetip.com.

The search for a hiker who was reported missing in Joshua Tree National Park on Friday was scaled back Wednesday, July 18, after another day of no sign of the man.


Paul Miller, 51, of Canada, was last seen by his wife about 9 a.m. Friday when he left for a hike on the 49 Palms Oasis trail. She reported him overdue about noon. His car was found in the parking lot at the trailhead.

At its height, the operation included 90 ground searchers, six K-9 teams, an ATV search team and a helicopter. Searchers will continue to look in areas with the highest probability of success, a Facebook post by the National Park Service said.


Officials ask that anyone with information on Miller’s whereabouts or who has any other helpful details call 909-383-5651.

Four years after its attendance numbers hit an all-time low, San Bernardino County Museum in 2016-17 continues to make gains in visitors, officials reported earlier this month.


Attendance at the main museum in Redlands slid to 38,000 in 2014 – down from 109,000 in 2001. In the past fiscal year, which ended June 30, attendance at the main museum rose to 63,351, a 66 percent increase from 2014.


Though attendance has yet to return to 2001 levels, museum and county officials are celebrating the turnaround.


“We’re totally excited that more people are coming because ultimately that’s what we want to do,” said museum director Melissa Russo. “We really want to connect residents to the culture and history and environment of the county.”


In 2014, a consulting firm recommended 29 changes at the museum, following revelations about problems in leadership.


Since then, the museum brought on Russo, successfully earned a 10-year accreditation, and has been steadily growing attendance numbers. The museum, based in Redlands with sites in Rancho Cucamonga, Colton, Yucaipa and more, saw a 14 percent increase in visitors to all sites in 2016-17.


At the Victor Valley Museum branch in Apple Valley alone, attendance grew 48 percent in the past year, from 5,523 to 8,222.


Russo said the museum’s success stems from increasing the rate of new exhibits and programs to keep visitors coming back. An increase in school field trips – up to 17,000 from about 13,500 students in the past year at the main museum alone – also helped.


Meanwhile, museum curators are broadening exhibits.


The “Minerals Rock! Unearthing the Human Element” exhibit, which opened July 5 in Redlands, isn’t just about geology, it includes biology and chemistry, and discusses mining in the area, cultural history, the different colors of minerals and how different cultures used them for dying textiles or making jewelry.


“We’re trying to make all of our exhibits very multi-disciplinary so that it tells a fuller story,” Russo said. “So a rock is not just a rock, it’s connected to everything else; it’s part of a story, it’s part of our history, it’s part of the industry of this area.”


“Mechanized Magic: 40 Years of Garner Holt Productions in San Bernardino County,” which runs through Nov. 25 in Redlands, is another crowd-pleaser, she said.


The show follows the rise of the animatronics giant, which was founded in 1977 in Holt’s parents’ San Bernardino garage, offering a look into science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics fields with hands-on opportunities.

In Apple Valley, attendance gains are thanks at least in part to the CuriousCITY exhibit for children under 5, which opened in August, Russo said.


The early-learning interactive play space encourages kids to use their imagination with a city theme, offering post office and store structures, and costumes.


Next up, the museum plans a citrus exhibit tying in agriculture and history. It’s set to open in May, with a tongue-in-cheek working title of “Pulp Culture.”

“We are seeing impressive measureable results in attracting visitors to our county museums,” Board of Supervisors Chairman Robert Lovingood said in a news release from the museum. “I think changes we’ve made in recent years are paying off, and I’m optimistic the trend will continue.”


Attendance, Russo said, is just one data point, “but I think it’s one of the most important ones that illustrates whether or not we’re of interest to the community. That’s our mission. If people aren’t coming, we might as well close our doors.”


The museum aims to exceed 100,000 visitors at the main site in Redlands by 2022.

Four years after its attendance numbers hit an all-time low, San Bernardino County Museum in 2016-17 continues to make gains in visitors, officials reported earlier this month.


Attendance at the main museum in Redlands slid to 38,000 in 2014 – down from 109,000 in 2001. In the past fiscal year, which ended June 30, attendance at the main museum rose to 63,351, a 66 percent increase from 2014.


Though attendance has yet to return to 2001 levels, museum and county officials are celebrating the turnaround.


“We’re totally excited that more people are coming because ultimately that’s what we want to do,” said museum director Melissa Russo. “We really want to connect residents to the culture and history and environment of the county.”


In 2014, a consulting firm recommended 29 changes at the museum, following revelations about problems in leadership.


Since then, the museum brought on Russo, successfully earned a 10-year accreditation, and has been steadily growing attendance numbers. The museum, based in Redlands with sites in Rancho Cucamonga, Colton, Yucaipa and more, saw a 14 percent increase in visitors to all sites in 2016-17.


At the Victor Valley Museum branch in Apple Valley alone, attendance grew 48 percent in the past year, from 5,523 to 8,222.


Russo said the museum’s success stems from increasing the rate of new exhibits and programs to keep visitors coming back. An increase in school field trips – up to 17,000 from about 13,500 students in the past year at the main museum alone – also helped.


Meanwhile, museum curators are broadening exhibits.


The “Minerals Rock! Unearthing the Human Element” exhibit, which opened July 5 in Redlands, isn’t just about geology, it includes biology and chemistry, and discusses mining in the area, cultural history, the different colors of minerals and how different cultures used them for dying textiles or making jewelry.


“We’re trying to make all of our exhibits very multi-disciplinary so that it tells a fuller story,” Russo said. “So a rock is not just a rock, it’s connected to everything else; it’s part of a story, it’s part of our history, it’s part of the industry of this area.”


“Mechanized Magic: 40 Years of Garner Holt Productions in San Bernardino County,” which runs through Nov. 25 in Redlands, is another crowd-pleaser, she said.


The show follows the rise of the animatronics giant, which was founded in 1977 in Holt’s parents’ San Bernardino garage, offering a look into science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics fields with hands-on opportunities.

In Apple Valley, attendance gains are thanks at least in part to the CuriousCITY exhibit for children under 5, which opened in August, Russo said.


The early-learning interactive play space encourages kids to use their imagination with a city theme, offering post office and store structures, and costumes.


Next up, the museum plans a citrus exhibit tying in agriculture and history. It’s set to open in May, with a tongue-in-cheek working title of “Pulp Culture.”

“We are seeing impressive measureable results in attracting visitors to our county museums,” Board of Supervisors Chairman Robert Lovingood said in a news release from the museum. “I think changes we’ve made in recent years are paying off, and I’m optimistic the trend will continue.”


Attendance, Russo said, is just one data point, “but I think it’s one of the most important ones that illustrates whether or not we’re of interest to the community. That’s our mission. If people aren’t coming, we might as well close our doors.”


The museum aims to exceed 100,000 visitors at the main site in Redlands by 2022.

Four years after its attendance numbers hit an all-time low, San Bernardino County Museum in 2016-17 continues to make gains in visitors, officials reported earlier this month.


Attendance at the main museum in Redlands slid to 38,000 in 2014 – down from 109,000 in 2001. In the past fiscal year, which ended June 30, attendance at the main museum rose to 63,351, a 66 percent increase from 2014.


Though attendance has yet to return to 2001 levels, museum and county officials are celebrating the turnaround.


“We’re totally excited that more people are coming because ultimately that’s what we want to do,” said museum director Melissa Russo. “We really want to connect residents to the culture and history and environment of the county.”


In 2014, a consulting firm recommended 29 changes at the museum, following revelations about problems in leadership.


Since then, the museum brought on Russo, successfully earned a 10-year accreditation, and has been steadily growing attendance numbers. The museum, based in Redlands with sites in Rancho Cucamonga, Colton, Yucaipa and more, saw a 14 percent increase in visitors to all sites in 2016-17.


At the Victor Valley Museum branch in Apple Valley alone, attendance grew 48 percent in the past year, from 5,523 to 8,222.


Russo said the museum’s success stems from increasing the rate of new exhibits and programs to keep visitors coming back. An increase in school field trips – up to 17,000 from about 13,500 students in the past year at the main museum alone – also helped.


Meanwhile, museum curators are broadening exhibits.


The “Minerals Rock! Unearthing the Human Element” exhibit, which opened July 5 in Redlands, isn’t just about geology, it includes biology and chemistry, and discusses mining in the area, cultural history, the different colors of minerals and how different cultures used them for dying textiles or making jewelry.


“We’re trying to make all of our exhibits very multi-disciplinary so that it tells a fuller story,” Russo said. “So a rock is not just a rock, it’s connected to everything else; it’s part of a story, it’s part of our history, it’s part of the industry of this area.”


“Mechanized Magic: 40 Years of Garner Holt Productions in San Bernardino County,” which runs through Nov. 25 in Redlands, is another crowd-pleaser, she said.


The show follows the rise of the animatronics giant, which was founded in 1977 in Holt’s parents’ San Bernardino garage, offering a look into science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics fields with hands-on opportunities.

In Apple Valley, attendance gains are thanks at least in part to the CuriousCITY exhibit for children under 5, which opened in August, Russo said.


The early-learning interactive play space encourages kids to use their imagination with a city theme, offering post office and store structures, and costumes.


Next up, the museum plans a citrus exhibit tying in agriculture and history. It’s set to open in May, with a tongue-in-cheek working title of “Pulp Culture.”

“We are seeing impressive measureable results in attracting visitors to our county museums,” Board of Supervisors Chairman Robert Lovingood said in a news release from the museum. “I think changes we’ve made in recent years are paying off, and I’m optimistic the trend will continue.”


Attendance, Russo said, is just one data point, “but I think it’s one of the most important ones that illustrates whether or not we’re of interest to the community. That’s our mission. If people aren’t coming, we might as well close our doors.”


The museum aims to exceed 100,000 visitors at the main site in Redlands by 2022.

By Margot Roosevelt | mroosevelt@scng.com | Orange County Register

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 4:32 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 9:44 pm

A Southern California car wash mogul cited for cheating more than 800 workers and destroying evidence will pay $4.2 million in back wages and penalties after a two-year court battle with federal authorities.


Vahid David Delrahim, of Los Angeles, failed to pay his workers minimum wage or overtime at a dozen car washes in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.


A consent decree approved this week by U.S. District Court Judge Fernando Olguin orders Delrahim to pay $1.9 million in back wages and another $1.9 million in damages to the workers. In addition, he is fined $400,000 in civil penalties.


“This landmark case sends a powerful message that the Department of Labor will use strong law enforcement and litigation tools to protect employees and level the playing field for law-abiding employers,” said Juan Coria, the wage and hour division’s acting regional commissioner.


According to the judgment, Delrahim ordered employees, many of them Spanish-speakers unfamiliar with U.S. labor laws, to work off the clock at the beginning of each shift and to clock out, but to remain at the car washes, when business was slow. The result: numerous hours without pay.


The court-ordered back wages cover a period from 2013 to the present. More workers and more money may be added to the case, according to the 42-page decree, as “the identity of all employees who worked [at the 12 car washes] is presently unknown.”


Delrahim is required to furnish more names, addresses and workplace records—originally requested by prosecutors in 2016—within 30 days.


As a result of the judgment, some employees will receive more than $10,000 in back wages.


Delrahim, a prominent member of Southern California’s Iranian diaspora and a cousin of President Donald Trump’s anti-trust chief, Makan Delrahim, owns more than 100 car washes and gas stations through Agoura Hills-based companies: Brea Car Wash & Detail Center (also known as Southwest Fuel Management), Goldenwest Solutions Group, and California Payroll Group.


David Delrahim

“We made a business decision to end the civil litigation,” his public relations firm said in a statement. “Our decision did not admit any wrongdoing on our part, but will enable the leaders and employees of our business to focus their time and effort on business instead of a costly civil trial.”


State and federal officials bring hundreds of wage theft claims each year against California car washes, garment contractors, caregiver facilities, restaurants and construction firms—the industries with the highest number of violations.


The Delrahim case is unusual in that few wage and hour disputes end up in court. But Delrahim hired one of the nation’s most aggressive employer law firms, Littler Mendelson, leading to two years of court battles and more than 200,000 pages in filings, documents, depositions and testimony.


Delrahim’s Los Angeles-based lawyer, Rebecca Aragon, specialized in helping “companies employing Spanish-speaking work forces” with “union avoidance” and other strategies, according to her firm biography.


The case exploded into a fight over legal ethics. Shortly after the investigation began, Delrahim and Littler were notified of the duty to preserve potential evidence. Nonetheless, text messages, email accounts and videos recording workers’ comings and goings, which prosecutors deemed likely to prove the government’s case, were destroyed.


The court sanctioned Delrahim and Littler five times for withholding documents and for coercive tactics towards employee witnesses. They were ordered to reimburse the government $23,850 in legal fees.


“The court’s decisions make clear that our laws protect workers and neither an employer nor their attorneys may interfere with their rights,” said Regional Solicitor Janet Herold.


The settlement attested to the lack of trust. It orders Delrahim not to encourage his managers “to ensure that labor costs are kept at or below a fixed percentage of the car wash’s sales.” And it appoints an “independent monitor” who can enter his car washes for a year without prior notice to inspect all payroll records and time cards.

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 4:32 pm | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 9:44 pm

A Southern California car wash mogul cited for cheating more than 800 workers and destroying evidence will pay $4.2 million in back wages and penalties after a two-year court battle with federal authorities.


Vahid David Delrahim, of Los Angeles, failed to pay his workers minimum wage or overtime at a dozen car washes in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.


A consent decree approved this week by U.S. District Court Judge Fernando Olguin orders Delrahim to pay $1.9 million in back wages and another $1.9 million in damages to the workers. In addition, he is fined $400,000 in civil penalties.


“This landmark case sends a powerful message that the Department of Labor will use strong law enforcement and litigation tools to protect employees and level the playing field for law-abiding employers,” said Juan Coria, the wage and hour division’s acting regional commissioner.


According to the judgment, Delrahim ordered employees, many of them Spanish-speakers unfamiliar with U.S. labor laws, to work off the clock at the beginning of each shift and to clock out, but to remain at the car washes, when business was slow. The result: numerous hours without pay.


The court-ordered back wages cover a period from 2013 to the present. More workers and more money may be added to the case, according to the 42-page decree, as “the identity of all employees who worked [at the 12 car washes] is presently unknown.”


Delrahim is required to furnish more names, addresses and workplace records—originally requested by prosecutors in 2016—within 30 days.


As a result of the judgment, some employees will receive more than $10,000 in back wages.


Delrahim, a prominent member of Southern California’s Iranian diaspora and a cousin of President Donald Trump’s anti-trust chief, Makan Delrahim, owns more than 100 car washes and gas stations through Agoura Hills-based companies: Brea Car Wash & Detail Center (also known as Southwest Fuel Management), Goldenwest Solutions Group, and California Payroll Group.


David Delrahim

“We made a business decision to end the civil litigation,” his public relations firm said in a statement. “Our decision did not admit any wrongdoing on our part, but will enable the leaders and employees of our business to focus their time and effort on business instead of a costly civil trial.”


State and federal officials bring hundreds of wage theft claims each year against California car washes, garment contractors, caregiver facilities, restaurants and construction firms—the industries with the highest number of violations.


The Delrahim case is unusual in that few wage and hour disputes end up in court. But Delrahim hired one of the nation’s most aggressive employer law firms, Littler Mendelson, leading to two years of court battles and more than 200,000 pages in filings, documents, depositions and testimony.


Delrahim’s Los Angeles-based lawyer, Rebecca Aragon, specialized in helping “companies employing Spanish-speaking work forces” with “union avoidance” and other strategies, according to her firm biography.


The case exploded into a fight over legal ethics. Shortly after the investigation began, Delrahim and Littler were notified of the duty to preserve potential evidence. Nonetheless, text messages, email accounts and videos recording workers’ comings and goings, which prosecutors deemed likely to prove the government’s case, were destroyed.


The court sanctioned Delrahim and Littler five times for withholding documents and for coercive tactics towards employee witnesses. They were ordered to reimburse the government $23,850 in legal fees.


“The court’s decisions make clear that our laws protect workers and neither an employer nor their attorneys may interfere with their rights,” said Regional Solicitor Janet Herold.


The settlement attested to the lack of trust. It orders Delrahim not to encourage his managers “to ensure that labor costs are kept at or below a fixed percentage of the car wash’s sales.” And it appoints an “independent monitor” who can enter his car washes for a year without prior notice to inspect all payroll records and time cards.

A Southern California car wash mogul cited for cheating more than 800 workers and destroying evidence will pay $4.2 million in back wages and penalties after a two-year court battle with federal authorities.

Delrahim, a prominent member of Southern California’s Iranian diaspora and a cousin of President Donald Trump’s anti-trust chief, Makan Delrahim, owns more than 100 car washes and gas stations through Agoura Hills-based companies: Brea Car Wash & Detail Center (also known as Southwest Fuel Management), Goldenwest Solutions Group, and California Payroll Group.

It orders Delrahim not to encourage his managers “to ensure that labor costs are kept at or below a fixed percentage of the car wash’s sales.” And it appoints an “independent monitor” who can enter his car washes for a year without prior notice to inspect all payroll records and time cards.


The dozen illegally operated car washes include:

  * Brea Car Wash & Detail Center (Brea)
  * Steve’s Detailing (Newport Beach)
  * Newport Coast Car Wash (Newport Beach)
  * Placentia Car Wash (Placentia)
  * Laguna Hills Auto Spa (Laguna Hills)

He deemed the two-story building a total loss. Authorities don’t know yet what caused the fire or the amount of damage it caused.


Pelletier said someone in the neighborhood saw smoke coming from the two-story strip mall and knocked on the door of a nearby fire station on Mountain Avenue.


Part of the building collapsed during the fire. He said there were two partial collapses. One occurred at 11:25 a.m. and the other happened at 12:43 p.m.


Most of the fire was out by Wednesday afternoon. However, Pelletier said there were still hot spots.


About 50 firefighters from Ontario Fire, Montclair Fire and the Chino Valley Fire District battled the blaze.

He deemed the two-story building a total loss. Authorities don’t know yet what caused the fire or the amount of damage it caused.


Pelletier said someone in the neighborhood saw smoke coming from the two-story strip mall and knocked on the door of a nearby fire station on Mountain Avenue.


Part of the building collapsed during the fire. He said there were two partial collapses. One occurred at 11:25 a.m. and the other happened at 12:43 p.m.


Most of the fire was out by Wednesday afternoon. However, Pelletier said there were still hot spots.


About 50 firefighters from Ontario Fire, Montclair Fire and the Chino Valley Fire District battled the blaze.

Raudel Felix García of Fontana thought someone was playing a cruel joke on him when he was told a decade ago that his brother had died after working in the grape fields of Kern County.


Audon Felix García had arrived from Zacatecas, Mexico just days before to work in the fields as he had done every other summer, his brother said. But the 41-year-old died two days after starting work loading boxes on the company truck, he said, due to temperatures that reached 112 degrees that summer day and employer “negligence” to properly care for him.


“It was hard to believe that he was simply gone,” a highly emotional Raudel Felix García, who owns his own landscaping business, said Tuesday in a media teleconference. “I had seen Audon five days before his death. He was healthy and ready to start another harvesting season.”

Now, Raudel Felix García is among those who are calling for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to establish the first federal standard that would protect workers from exposure to excessive heat.


“I don’t want any more families to go through the pain that my family went through,” he said.


RELATED STORY: U.S. Postal Service worker found dead in Woodland Hills amid Friday’s record-breaking heat


More than 100 labor, public health, environmental justice and environmental groups along with former occupational regulators and other individual petitioners submitted a petition to the federal agency calling for national protections for workers – both indoor and outdoor – who are at risk from extreme heat.


It marks the launch of a national campaign by the consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen, the United Farm Workers Foundation and Farmworker Justice and others in an effort to raise awareness about the effects of climate change on workers’ health and safety.


“Preventing heat illness is urgently needed now more than ever,” Ellen Widess, a former Cal/OSHA chief and a board member of Farmworker Justice, said on the call. “Given climate change, rising heat, high-heat incidents and expanding areas of California and the nation which experience high heat, we have to do something.”


U.S. Rep. Judy Chu, D-Pasadena, said she plans to introduce legislation in Congress that would require the federal government to develop federal heat protection standards. These standards would likely require employers to provide workplaces with water, shade and rest breaks if needed to recover from the heat, similar to what California already requires.


The planned legislation would also direct employers to provide training for employees about risk factors that can lead to heat illness, Chu said.


“All workers should benefit from safe conditions whenever they work outside in the heat no matter where they are,” she said.

Locally, the issue of working in extreme heat gained attention recently after U.S. postal carrier Peggy Frank, 63, was found dead July 6 in her mail truck on a 117-degree day in Woodland Hills. Authorities, including OSHA, are probing whether heat was a factor.


Employers are obligated to protect employees from any hazardous condition, including potential heat stress, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.


In the case of the U.S. Postal Service, carriers are reminded daily to stay hydrated throughout their route, wear appropriate clothing, such as hats, and get into the shade whenever and as much as possible, officials said.


In 2005, after a series of farmworker deaths, California became the first state in the country to issue comprehensive heat standard protections for workers. Those regulations were strengthened a decade later and have likely saved lives, activists and experts say.


While there have been some tragic cases of heat-related deaths in the state since then, Chu said it’s probably related to enforcement of the state’s regulations.


“We feel it’s related to whether there are people being sent out to see whether employers are really doing their job and whether they are holding them accountable,” she said.


Chu added that she’s hopeful that the new legislation will tackle this problem.

That sentiment was echoed by Widess, the former Cal/Osha chief, who said that even in a state like California, it’s important to increase enforcement capacity of regulatory agencies.


“More inspectors are needed to make sure employers are doing right by workers, taking every step needed, and OSHA is chronically understaffed nationally,” she said.

Raudel Felix García of Fontana thought someone was playing a cruel joke on him when he was told a decade ago that his brother had died after working in the grape fields of Kern County.


Audon Felix García had arrived from Zacatecas, Mexico just days before to work in the fields as he had done every other summer, his brother said. But the 41-year-old died two days after starting work loading boxes on the company truck, he said, due to temperatures that reached 112 degrees that summer day and employer “negligence” to properly care for him.


“It was hard to believe that he was simply gone,” a highly emotional Raudel Felix García, who owns his own landscaping business, said Tuesday in a media teleconference. “I had seen Audon five days before his death. He was healthy and ready to start another harvesting season.”

Now, Raudel Felix García is among those who are calling for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to establish the first federal standard that would protect workers from exposure to excessive heat.


“I don’t want any more families to go through the pain that my family went through,” he said.


RELATED STORY: U.S. Postal Service worker found dead in Woodland Hills amid Friday’s record-breaking heat


More than 100 labor, public health, environmental justice and environmental groups along with former occupational regulators and other individual petitioners submitted a petition to the federal agency calling for national protections for workers – both indoor and outdoor – who are at risk from extreme heat.


It marks the launch of a national campaign by the consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen, the United Farm Workers Foundation and Farmworker Justice and others in an effort to raise awareness about the effects of climate change on workers’ health and safety.


“Preventing heat illness is urgently needed now more than ever,” Ellen Widess, a former Cal/OSHA chief and a board member of Farmworker Justice, said on the call. “Given climate change, rising heat, high-heat incidents and expanding areas of California and the nation which experience high heat, we have to do something.”


U.S. Rep. Judy Chu, D-Pasadena, said she plans to introduce legislation in Congress that would require the federal government to develop federal heat protection standards. These standards would likely require employers to provide workplaces with water, shade and rest breaks if needed to recover from the heat, similar to what California already requires.


The planned legislation would also direct employers to provide training for employees about risk factors that can lead to heat illness, Chu said.


“All workers should benefit from safe conditions whenever they work outside in the heat no matter where they are,” she said.


RELATED STORY: Federal investigators launch probe into Woodland Hills mail carrier’s death on 117-degree day


Locally, the issue of working in extreme heat gained attention recently after U.S. postal carrier Peggy Frank, 63, was found dead July 6 in her mail truck on a 117-degree day in Woodland Hills. Authorities, including OSHA, are probing whether heat was a factor.


Employers are obligated to protect employees from any hazardous condition, including potential heat stress, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.


In the case of the U.S. Postal Service, carriers are reminded daily to stay hydrated throughout their route, wear appropriate clothing, such as hats, and get into the shade whenever and as much as possible, officials said.


In 2005, after a series of farmworker deaths, California became the first state in the country to issue comprehensive heat standard protections for workers. Those regulations were strengthened a decade later and have likely saved lives, activists and experts say.


While there have been some tragic cases of heat-related deaths in the state since then, Chu said it’s probably related to enforcement of the state’s regulations.


“We feel it’s related to whether there are people being sent out to see whether employers are really doing their job and whether they are holding them accountable,” she said.


Chu added that she’s hopeful that the new legislation will tackle this problem.

That sentiment was echoed by Widess, the former Cal/Osha chief, who said that even in a state like California, it’s important to increase enforcement capacity of regulatory agencies.


“More inspectors are needed to make sure employers are doing right by workers, taking every step needed, and OSHA is chronically understaffed nationally,” she said.

Dollar deals


McDonald’s fans, if you haven’t yet downloaded the chain’s mobile app, now is a good time to do so.


The app features weekly deals and the chain recently pushed some longer-term deep discounts that are worth taking advantage of.


Through the app, guests can purchase any sandwich — with the exception of a Signature Crafted sandwich or a double Quarter Pounder with Cheese — for just $1.


The deal is good once daily through Sept. 30.


Also available is a deal allowing the purchase of any size McCafé beverage for $1, which is valid once daily through Dec. 30.


Sorry, Starbucks.


Other long-term deals available through the app include:

  * $1 McDouble sandwich (valid once daily through Dec. 30)
  * $3 off a $10 purchase (valid once daily through Dec. 30)
  * 20-piece McNuggets for $4.99 (valid once daily through Dec. 30)
  * Buy one McCafé beverage (excluding drip and iced coffee), get one for one cent (valid once daily through Sept. 30)
  * Free hash browns with the purchase of any breakfast sandwich (valid once daily through Aug. 19)

These deals are in addition to the chain’s weekly deals, which in recent weeks have included a buy-one-get-one deal (either free or for $1) on Quarter Pounder with Cheese burgers.


The McDonald’s app, which also allows mobile ordering, is available for Android and iOS.


Free phone from Farmer Boys


Another app-related deal is being advertised by Farmer Boys.


The chain is offering a free Android smartphone with the purchase of two months of service for $100.


To begin the process, simply download the chain’s Very Important Farmer Loyalty Club app on Android or iOS or sign up by visiting www.farmerboys.com/vif.


The app allows guests to earn free food by scanning their receipts when they visit. New members also receive a $5 credit just for signing up.


Also, the chain is giving a bonus $8 credit for guests who visit three times in July and spend at least $5 each visit.


Details on the app and the free phone offer can be found at www.farmerboys.com/promotions.


Beer and bites for charity


Barons Market has announced its latest Backroom Beer Pairing, which is set for Wednesday, July 25.


The partner brewery for this month’s event is San Diego-based Thorn Brewing Company.

  * Rock the Pale Ale paired with Spicy Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 8:46 am | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 10:23 pm

Five men police call gang members have been charged in the San Bernardino shooting death of a wife of a Mexican Mafia member, authorities said on Wednesday, adding that the killing was orchestrated behind bars and one of the accused has since been slain.


The Jan. 18, 2017 death of Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez, 41, of North Hills was planned by the five defendants — three of whom were in the state prison system while the plot came together — said authorities, who have not disclosed a possible motive for the killing. While the charges don’t name the alleged shooter or shooters, one defendant is charged with being a felon in possession of a handgun the night of the shooting.


The victim was previously identified by authorities as Carmen Gutierrez Rodriguez.


The complaint filed in the case said the slaying was “for the benefit, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang,” and was done to further criminal conduct by gang members. It also accuses the defendants of street terrorism.


The victim’s husband, convicted armed robber Andrew Rodriguez, identified by police as a Mexican Mafia prison gang member, died three months after her slaying, at Pelican Bay State Prison, on April 20, 2017. His death remains under investigation as suspicious, police said.


On July 11, the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office quietly filed murder charges against the five accused gang members, with one, Eric Moreno, 30, killed just days later in his cell on Sunday in Kern Valley State Prison. Police declined to comment Wednesday on a motive in Moreno’s death. His cellmate, also from San Bernardino County, was named by prison officials as a suspect.

The arrests and charges in the woman’s murder case were the result of an investigation by a multi-agency task force formed after the slaying, San Bernardino police said in a statement.


Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez, a mother of five, was shot to death in a parking lot outside a cafe in the 1600 block of North Mt. Vernon Avenue.


Her husband was a member of the San Bernardino-based Westside Verdugo gang before being inducted into the Mexican Mafia while in prison, police said. He was serving a 115-years-to-life, three-strike armed-robbery sentence, records show.


Besides Moreno, those charged in Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez’s slaying were Isaac Aguirre, 44; Robert Fernandez, 43; Richard Garcia, 45; and Matthew Manzano, 35.


Police said Moreno, Garcia and Manzano were in California prisons when the slaying was planned and carried out, and the two still alive remain in prison custody.


Manzano was sentenced in San Bernardino County Superior Court in 2010 to two consecutive life-without-parole terms for the deaths of two men in 2005.


Moreno was sentenced in San Bernardino County Superior Court to 10 years in prison April 22, 2015 on his guilty plea to possession of a firearm by a felon and the enhancement of participation in a street gang, court records show.


State prison officials said Moreno’s cellmate, Daniel Olguin, 36, and also from San Bernardino County, is the suspect in Moreno’s death. Olguin was sentenced in 2017 to life-with-the-possibility of parole for his role, with two others, of murder, torture and false imprisonment in a 2005 death.


Garcia was sentenced to life without parole on April 21, 1998 in San Bernardino County Superior Court on a murder case, court records show. Aguirre and Fernandez are now in local custody, the police statement said. Aguirre is accused of both murder and being a felon in possession of a handgun the night of the shooting.


Court records show both men have pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges in connection with the Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez slaying.


Four of the men charged in the murder were identified as members of the Westside Verdugo gang, police said, while Manzano is from an unidentified Redlands gang. Police said the gangs are obedient or submissive to the Mexican Mafia’s orders from prison.


The task force’s effort, “Operation Green Hand,” also resulted in 86 other arrests on suspicion of various weapons, conspiracy, auto theft and narcotics charges. Those arrests were announced last year.


“The purpose of this task force was to target gang members in prison whom were attempting to influence the local street gangs of San Bernardino in addition to identify those who were involved in the murder of Carmen Rodriguez,” the police statement said.


Agencies involved in the task force include the San Bernardino Police Department’s Homicide Unit, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, Fontana police, the FBI; the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the California Highway Patrol and the state Department of Justice.

PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 8:46 am | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 10:23 pm

Five men police call gang members have been charged in the San Bernardino shooting death of a wife of a Mexican Mafia member, authorities said on Wednesday, adding that the killing was orchestrated behind bars and one of the accused has since been slain.


The Jan. 18, 2017 death of Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez, 41, of North Hills was planned by the five defendants — three of whom were in the state prison system while the plot came together — said authorities, who have not disclosed a possible motive for the killing. While the charges don’t name the alleged shooter or shooters, one defendant is charged with being a felon in possession of a handgun the night of the shooting.


The victim was previously identified by authorities as Carmen Gutierrez Rodriguez.


The complaint filed in the case said the slaying was “for the benefit, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang,” and was done to further criminal conduct by gang members. It also accuses the defendants of street terrorism.


The victim’s husband, convicted armed robber Andrew Rodriguez, identified by police as a Mexican Mafia prison gang member, died three months after her slaying, at Pelican Bay State Prison, on April 20, 2017. His death remains under investigation as suspicious, police said.


On July 11, the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office quietly filed murder charges against the five accused gang members, with one, Eric Moreno, 30, killed just days later in his cell on Sunday in Kern Valley State Prison. Police declined to comment Wednesday on a motive in Moreno’s death. His cellmate, also from San Bernardino County, was named by prison officials as a suspect.

The arrests and charges in the woman’s murder case were the result of an investigation by a multi-agency task force formed after the slaying, San Bernardino police said in a statement.


Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez, a mother of five, was shot to death in a parking lot outside a cafe in the 1600 block of North Mt. Vernon Avenue.


Her husband was a member of the San Bernardino-based Westside Verdugo gang before being inducted into the Mexican Mafia while in prison, police said. He was serving a 115-years-to-life, three-strike armed-robbery sentence, records show.


Besides Moreno, those charged in Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez’s slaying were Isaac Aguirre, 44; Robert Fernandez, 43; Richard Garcia, 45; and Matthew Manzano, 35.


Police said Moreno, Garcia and Manzano were in California prisons when the slaying was planned and carried out, and the two still alive remain in prison custody.


Manzano was sentenced in San Bernardino County Superior Court in 2010 to two consecutive life-without-parole terms for the deaths of two men in 2005.


Moreno was sentenced in San Bernardino County Superior Court to 10 years in prison April 22, 2015 on his guilty plea to possession of a firearm by a felon and the enhancement of participation in a street gang, court records show.


State prison officials said Moreno’s cellmate, Daniel Olguin, 36, and also from San Bernardino County, is the suspect in Moreno’s death. Olguin was sentenced in 2017 to life-with-the-possibility of parole for his role, with two others, of murder, torture and false imprisonment in a 2005 death.


Garcia was sentenced to life without parole on April 21, 1998 in San Bernardino County Superior Court on a murder case, court records show. Aguirre and Fernandez are now in local custody, the police statement said. Aguirre is accused of both murder and being a felon in possession of a handgun the night of the shooting.


Court records show both men have pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges in connection with the Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez slaying.


Four of the men charged in the murder were identified as members of the Westside Verdugo gang, police said, while Manzano is from an unidentified Redlands gang. Police said the gangs are obedient or submissive to the Mexican Mafia’s orders from prison.


The task force’s effort, “Operation Green Hand,” also resulted in 86 other arrests on suspicion of various weapons, conspiracy, auto theft and narcotics charges. Those arrests were announced last year.


“The purpose of this task force was to target gang members in prison whom were attempting to influence the local street gangs of San Bernardino in addition to identify those who were involved in the murder of Carmen Rodriguez,” the police statement said.


Agencies involved in the task force include the San Bernardino Police Department’s Homicide Unit, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, Fontana police, the FBI; the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the California Highway Patrol and the state Department of Justice.

It’s stupid that I have to pay to know the news what goes on in my own backyard. Sorry but I rather pay for more important things. But thank you that now I won’t be able to know what goes on.

I like the local news. However, all the national news is just UP copy, which is always Trump bashing, no matter what the topic. Usually it is so bad and blatant that it is laughable. I would like to s...ubscribe to a more unbiased paper, with local news, but I have not found it yet. Also, of course it keeps getting more expensive. This must be why most people do not take a paper, but get their news off the internet. See More

Like receiving the newspaper but the price is just way too high, my own fault for not following up on credit card bill. No wonder most businesses want auto bill.
I have subscribed to this newspaper f...or over 30 years until today,
$200.31 for 3 months.........no more. See More

Absolutely worse. Somehow they have my checking Information. I have called with no reply. I’ve emailed with no reply. Multiple times I’ve gone down to my bank and in order to get rid of this reoccurri...ng charge to my account is to close my bank account. Crock of shit company. Charging me for over a year and I’ve never requested the delivery. See More

Been taking paper for 26 years and had minor delivery problems here and there. Then, the last couple of months it's been unbelievable. August I was missed 5 times and when I call I get the "" I'm so so...rry, it will be there within 90 minutes. After two to three more calls the paper never comes. I finally call Mr. Pine the editor and he tells me he will check into it. I receive a call from another VP who says I will get my paper and this won't happen again. I finally get it at 6:45 that night and it's here the next morning. So, I pay the bill. And bang, three skips so far in Sept. What is funny is that I will talk to Managers and Supervisors who promise me that the paper will be delivered in 90 minutes and it never even shows up. One time I did get it the next day. So, after 26 years, I finally cancelled my subscription with NO resistance whatsoever-- no please stay, or more broken promises-- just okay, goodbye. I really enjoyed the paper but this just got ridiculous. See More

The page is great on reporting local activities, but it comes with an absolutely toxic community. Every article gets turned into a hate filled rant in the comments. I went as far as to message the pag...e to help moderate the comments, but it would seem that likes and racist followers are more important. See More

Delivery? Hello? I call the number and hear (recorded message) there are problems, but paper should be delivered by 9AM.
11AM, no one in subscriber service, but if I want my paper delivered today, I ...can pay for the privilege. Missed me last week, too, but my kid had brought the Times with him, so I didn't say anything. These idiots bugged me to resubscribe and I did, Sunday edition only. What are the chances I'll make this mistake again? See More

Had a high school kid come around saying he was trying to earn money for a trip for something at school. He guaranteed me it would only be for the 4 weeks. I told him I did not want to enroll on auto ...pay . I have been charged now 9.95 on my credit card 3x already one time it caused me to go over my credit limit So I don't know of this kid checked the enroll in auto pay part after he gave me my bottom receipt or what. I thought I was helping a kid out but I don't want to be subscribed any longer please. See More

Recently had a high school kid come to my door and ask if I wanted to either sign up for a paper subscription or purchase a gift card to Target through the paper to help them finance a scholarship. I ...informed her that I didn't want to sign up for the paper at all but I would be willing to purchase a gift card after she informed me specifically that doing so would not allow me to be enrolled into paper deliveries or cause me to pay anything for the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin. After questioning her repeatedly about clarifying that I would only be signing up for a gift card I agreed to do so. Sure enough a week later I start receiving papers and get a call from the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin thanking me for my recent subscription. After calling the phone number for the paper they told me that the gift card purchase was not accurately explained to me and that I was signed up for the paper by the girl who spoke to me. Their solution was to refund me $6.92 for the $10 I paid.

So who cares right? I lost out on $3 oh well. That's not what bothered me. The fact that either this organization is not doing a good job of explaining their program to the children who are selling it for them (which is possible) or the child that they employed is the kind of person that would purposely deceive people to make profit or work for an organization that tells them to be dishonest in doing so is what I find troubling. Due to the lack of help I got from the customer service when gracefully explaining the situation and the other similar reviews left on this page I would have to believe that this organization is not one I am interesting in supporting. Disappointing. See More

I read the Daily Bulletin on a regular basis. I find a lot a useful information. My co-workers also spend a few moments prior to work to go through the paper. We often discuss information we find. A ...concern I have is that recently my son began wrestling for his high school. I decided to check the paper the day following after a great win over last seasons league champions. To my surprise I could not find anything regarding wrestling. Especially after all the lengths people went to save wrestling for the Olympics. Wrestling is one of the oldest, toughest sports. It caries traditions, helps build character and confidence in our youths. Many stars have come out in support. It would seem that whoever is responsible for running the sports columns has something against wrestling. It has been said that wrestling is the core to most of today's MMA fighters and some of our top athletes in other sports. Please help bring back wrestling. Support it by reporting the events. Not asking for any special attention just equal. I read a few columns on basketball and soccer today and wished the same for wrestling. Thank you. See More

We switched to the Sunday only delivery several months ago and love having the Digital editions all week.
Recently we went on vacation and took the Daily Bulletin with us, our Daughter took several p...ictures of us holding the paper. I submitted one taken at the Vatican and sent it in to the paper about 2 weeks ago, much to our surprise it was published this morning and the names were spelled correctly.
Thank you very much.

Our family has subscribed since it was the Progress Bulletin in the 1960s, and it was a much better publication initially. But now I am cancelling as it gets thinner and thinner, and news comes up hou...rs or days quicker online or on the local news. We used to own birds and each issue was enough for a complete change of multiple cages...now it would take 2-3 weekdays to amass enough for the large parrot cage. See More

The Daily Bulletin is not dependable. I do not know who delivers their papers but they are terrible. We have not gotten our paper on several occasions. We called three times today and at 8:30 this mor...ning we were told our paper would be delivered. It is after 3:00 and we have given up. We are ready to cancel. Anyone else having problems?

It's always difficult to sit back and think of what happened beforehand. We as a people need to not act afterwards but pay attention to if they reach out beforehand. We call that ""preventive maintenan...ce ."" It's hard for some but easier for the ones who care. Some of these things could have been avoided on his, his partner, and the situation that involved themselves in. He is a man that stretches out for those around him. Water on a rock whittles it over time. A hammered rock breaks quickly under repeated impact. Leave it alone, it stays strong! See More

Anyone who hasn’t been to Anaheim’s Downtown Disney recently may be startled by the sweeping changes they’ll find, including shuttered restaurants and businesses that make the west end of the district resemble a failed mall.


The closures are only temporary, though, as the closed businesses along the western edge of the retail and dining district, including the Rainforest Cafe, ESPN Zone, Earl of Sandwich and the AMC Theatres will eventually be hidden by construction walls and then demolished to make way for a posh new hotel slated to open in 2021. It will be built on 17 acres comprising the west side of the outdoor mall to the border of the existing Disneyland Hotel.


Other buildings are also vacant, as they are being remodeled to make way for new venues. In the mall’s center, the shuttered building that formerly contained the Build-a-Bear and RideMakerz shops is undergoing renovations from kid-friendly shops into new dining-and-drinking spots emphasizing craft beer including Ballast Point, a microbrewery out of San Diego and Black Tap Craft Burgers & Beer.


This is the first comprehensive overhaul of the property since it opened in January 2001. Downtown Disney originally developed as part of a massive project that included the creation of Disney California Adventure theme park from the former Disneyland parking lot and one of the largest parking garages in the nation. The district was designed to link Disney California Adventure with the existing Disneyland and capture extra tourist dollars on site, rather than letting them slip away to other businesses along Harbor Boulevard.


When it first opened, the district was also popular with locals looking for Disney-themed shopping, dining, seeing a movie at the AMC Theatres and maybe even watching the Disneyland fireworks from outside the park.


But the parking lot set aside specifically for Downtown Disney visitors became so overcrowded that parking validation policies were tightened, making it costly for locals to use the space as an outdoor mall without spending money. Nowadays, many users believe that Disney officials want to court out-of-town visitors who will open their wallets wider, catering to them with the new hotel and other businesses that serve travelers.


“It seems like they’re trying to get more dollars spent per head as opposed to people like me, who will just walk around and buy a churro and eat occasionally,” Disney fan and annual passholder Roger Yamashita said. “I’ve been to every Disney park in the world and it seems like they are trying to adopt more of a Walt Disney World model, to make it for a vacation destination.”


In the past, Yamashita, who lives in Yorba Linda, said he and his friends would drop by after work or on a Sunday afternoon to enjoy the frequent live music, go to ESPN Zone or eat at Naples Ristorante. “I imagine I’ll still be going, but not as often.”


Yamashita cited the closure of the most affordable restaurant at Downtown Disney – the popular Earl of Sandwich – as another way that locals will be discouraged from visiting the district.


Locals who patronized the former House of Blues music venue have also moved over to the nearby Anaheim GardenWalk mall, since it was replaced by bowling-drinking-and-dining venue Splitsville.


Disneyland spokeswoman Liz Jaeger declined to discuss any particular plan behind the renovations, except to say that the many changes will result in “a fresh, one-of-a-kind Disney experience, providing guests of all ages a mix of family-friendly dining, shopping and entertainment.”


Soon, people seeking to park their cars at the Downtown Disney will be diverted to a new location, while heavy equipment will move in to begin construction of the new 700-room hotel, expected to open in 2021. Its ground floor will house restaurants and shops, and Disney fans are hoping places like the Earl of Sandwich will relocate there. For now, though, parking and security entrances will remain the same at least until some time in August.


The as-yet-unnamed hotel will cater to upscale guests and will feature the chance to board the monorail inside the structure. Disneyland Resort currently has three hotel properties in Anaheim: The Disneyland Hotel, Disney’s Grand Californian and Disney’s Paradise Pier. A master plan shows how they would all be linked after the area is redeveloped.

The women who spoke out against the abuse by Larry Nassar stood together Wednesday night in a powerful and solemn closing to the show highlighting the past year’s top athletes and moments in sports.


Gymnast Aly Raisman, softball player Tiffany Thomas Lopez and gymnast Sarah Klein, who said she was Nassar’s first victim 30 years ago, took turns speaking. Klein chided the U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State for placing “money and medals above the safety of child athletes.”


Olympic snowboarding champion Chloe Kim won a leading three ESPYs, including best female athlete, while Alex Ovechkin claimed best male athlete.


Kim had tears in her eyes as she listened to the Arthur Ashe recipients.


“We must start caring about children’s safety more than we care about adults’ reputations,” Klein said. “If we can just give one person the courage to use their voice, this is worth it.”


Raisman added, “For too long we were ignored. It could have been avoided. All we needed was one adult to have the integrity to stand between us and Larry Nassar.”


“To all the survivors out there, don't let anyone rewrite your story. Your truth does matter. You matter. And you are not alone.”

The audience gave the group a prolonged standing ovation and remained on its feet while the women spoke.


“What a powerful stage up here,” host Danica Patrick said before signing off.


Ovechkin joined Roger Federer and Olympic snowboarder Shaun White as double winners. Ovechkin was in Russia with his wife, Nastya, who is 8½ months pregnant.Newly retired racecar driver Patrick became the first woman to host the show at the Microsoft Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Her opening monologue mostly fell flat, with athletes sitting stone-faced or wincing at many of the jokes.


Kim took female athlete honors over Olympic skier Mikaela Shiffrin, WNBA player Sylvia Fowles and soccer player Julie Ertz.


“This year has been filled with so many incredible memories I will hold onto the rest of my life,” Kim said as she held the silver trophy. “I really want to thank my family. They’ve sacrificed so much for me.”


Kim also claimed trophies for best female Olympian and female action sports athlete. At the Pyeongchang Games in February, she became the youngest to win a snowboarding medal when the then-17-year-old claimed gold in halfpipe.


Ovechkin, who led the Washington Capitals to their first Stanley Cup championship, also won for best NHL player. He beat out Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and fellow first-time nominees Jose Altuve of the Houston Astros and James Harden of the Houston Rockets for male athlete.


Federer’s five-set victory at the Australian Open in January for his 20th Grand Slam singles title earned honors for record-breaking performance and he also received best male tennis player.


White won best Olympic moment with his final-run performance in South Korea featuring back-to-back 1440s to take gold, and best male Olympian.


The Astros were honored as best team for winning the franchise’s first World Series.

Let’s politely say the conclusions varied.


So who’s correct? Who do you trust? Retirement choices are no small matter.


Let me take a literal middle ground by considering their collective wisdom. As a public service, my trusty spreadsheet helped me combine this trio of retirement location rankings to give a better picture of the varying strengths vs. weaknesses of the states.


I reassembled their published ranking data — overall scores, subindex grades and related data — into three evenly weighted metrics: costs (buying power); character (culture and climate); and care (healthcare and healthiness). What did I learn?


Florida is the place to retire, statistically speaking to my composite index. It ranked No. 1 for costs and character. But if you don’t care for humidity, and enjoy winter’s chill, No. 2 was South Dakota, which enjoyed No. 4 grades for costs and care.


Third-ranked was New Hampshire (No. 4 for character; 10th-best for care), then Virginia: (ninth-best for character) and Hawaii (No. 40 for costs but No. 1 for care!)


Conversely, don’t think about Louisiana for your golden years, according to my math. It ranked last in my reassembled scorecard. Why? No. 49 for character and No. 50 for care.


Next worst score was Arkansas (No. 47 for character), then came Kentucky (No. 47 for care); New Mexico (No. 46 for character) and Illinois (No. 41 for care).


What about California? By my math, the Golden State ranked a middle-of-the-pack 26th for one’s golden years. California’s seventh-worst ranking for costs was improved by a No. 16 grade for character and No. 18 for care.


Here is how the 50 states ranked as retirement options in order of my overall scoring then broken down by ranking for cost, character and care quality.

In year’s past it’s been a limited edition Funko Pop, a special print from that one show or an enamel pin. This year, the thing that many people were itching to take home with them wasn’t on the convention center floor but in the bathrooms.

Con-goers making a quite pit stop were pleasantly surprised by toilet seat covers emblazoned with the face of Deadpool and the message, “This is all Fox could afford. Deadpool 2 dropping soon on Blu-ray and digital.”


The seat covers were so popular, fans could be seen grabbing them by the handful and stuffing them into their complimentary SDCC bags.


One convention center worker said she’d been replacing the protective tissue paper much more frequently than years past.


Photos of the covers began to show up on social media celebrating Fox’s ingenious marketing ploy.

As with most Comic-Con exclusives, this one ended up on eBay only hours after the convention floor opened on the Wednesday, July 18, for Preview Night.


One enterpeneur wanted $60, plus shipping and handling, for a cover signed by Deadpool co-creator, Rob Liefeld. Most however ran on average for about $15 to $20 a pop.


I’m deluged with this!! Signing these left and right on the street corner!!! https://t.co/WqR9jFM87N

It’s unclear if the San Diego Convention Center was provided with enough seat covers to last the length of SDCC, but some women coming out of one of the bathrooms on preview night commented many of the stalls were without the coveted covers.


The first night of Comic-Con will officially kick off Thursday, July 19, and will run until Sunday, July 22.

Riverside County Department of Animal Services spokesman John Welsh said the feral donkey was wounded over the weekend, and a concerned resident posted images of the animal to social media, catching the attention of authorities.


Welsh described the attack on the burro as a “terrible act of cruelty” that left the animal in need of veterinary care.


The burro was spotted in the Reche Canyon area, in the vicinity of the Black Stallion Ranch, north of Moreno Valley, and animal control officers went to the location Wednesday afternoon, Welsh said.


“We shot it with two tranquilizer darts, but efforts to capture the wild burro were unsuccessful,” Welsh said. “The darts should have been enough, and we are uncertain why they were not effective.


“It could have been a result of the animal being worked up earlier, prior to our arrival,” he said.


The arrow was no longer protruding from the creature when the darts were injected, but the wound was still visible, according to Welsh


Officers will return to the area Thursday morning to have another go at corralling the burro.


Welsh said the nonprofit DonkeyLand rescue organization has been alerted and will be enlisted to assist.


Officials asked anyone with information regarding who might have injured the donkey to contact the Department of Animal Services at (951) 358-7387.


Herds of wild burros populate the Pigeon Pass and Reche Canyon areas between Moreno Valley and Colton. Riverside County Ordinance No. 934 makes it unlawful to feed, pet or otherwise draw the donkeys toward roadsides and other locations where they might be hurt — or wander into traffic and cause accidents.

The two-bedroom, three-bathroom house in the 11200 block of Dilling Street, adjacent to the Los Angeles River, is listed for $1.885 million, according to Ernie Carswell, a Douglas Elliman agent who is listing what he said “is reportedly the second most photographed home in the United States after the White House.”


The home’s interior does not match what was shown in the 1969-74 ABC series because those scenes were filmed at Paramount Studios, Carswell told the Los Angeles Times.


Several homes in the neighborhood have been demolished recently. The owners will give first consideration to bidders who want to keep the home intact, Carswell told The Times.


“We’re not going to accept the first big offer from a developer who wants to tear it down,” Carswell told The Times. “We’re going to wait a few days, in case there are others who want to purchase it as an investment to preserve it.”

Bracken Blucher pleaded guilty in May to manufacturing illegal drugs, causing a fire that resulted in property damage and a sentence-enhancing allegation of causing damage to multiple structures in a fire.


A home in the 33000 block of East Harvest Way in Wildomar was destroyed early Wednesday, July 19, 2017, in an explosion and fire that also sent one person to the hospital and damaged a neighboring house. Sheriff’s officials were investigating whether an illegal drug lab producing “honey oil” was to blame. (Photo by Frank Bellino, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG)

A Riverside County Superior Court judge certified the plea terms and imposed the sentence recommended by the Department of Probation.


The judge additionally ordered Blucher to pay victim restitution in an amount that will be determined by the agency.


Blucher was in the process of making a marijuana derivative known as “honey oil” in the predawn hours of July 19, 2017, when his residence erupted in flames from a butane gas explosion.


The blaze on Harvest Way, near Cornstalk Road, was reported at 4 a.m.


According to county fire officials, a 1,200-square foot modular home was consumed by the conflagration, and a neighboring single-story residence was moderately damaged.


Blucher suffered minor to moderate burns that required emergency treatment.


Investigators found butane gas cannisters scattered throughout the street and yard fronting the property where the fire started.

Seven engine crews and a truck company, numbering about 30 personnel, spent nearly an hour battling the flames before they were fully contained.


Three people living in the modular home with Blucher were displaced. Three adults and a child from the neighboring property required temporary lodgings.


Ironically, the blaze occurred one day after the District Attorney’s Office released a series of public service announcements warning of the perils of butane honey oil production.


The videos featured Alex Gonzales and his girlfriend Selina Cervantes, both of whom were severely burned in a butane honey oil blaze at a Palm Springs motel in February 2015. Cervantes suffered second- and third-degree burns to 97 percent of her body and was permanently disfigured.


“People need to understand that the butane honey oil extraction process takes lives — it hurts people forever,” District Attorney Mike Hestrin said before unveiling the public service announcements. “We want to put an end to the manufacture of butane honey oil.”Drug lab operators use butane to extract tincture from cannabis plants. The product, often referred to as “wax” or hash, can be mixed with anything and bottled.


Butane honey oil labs have sprung up in both remote and heavily populated areas of the county. In the past few years, butane honey oil fires have erupted in Cathedral City, Moreno Valley, Murrieta, Norco and Riverside.

About Southern California News Group


Groundbreaking


Established in March 2016, the Southern California News Group (SCNG) has virtually overnight become one of the most powerful and influential news organizations in the U.S. This dynamic union was created when the Los Angeles News Group (owners of nine local daily newspapers and websites) and its parent company Digital First Media (DFM) acquired Freedom Communications (owners of the Orange County Register and Riverside Press-Enterprise).


By combining these two highly regarded and well-established institutions, SCNG has emerged as the largest news content provider in the five-county Los Angeles metropolitan area. As a leader in circulation among top publications nationwide, SCNG now owns and operates 11 local daily newspapers and more than a dozen community weeklies.


Our mission is to connect communities by providing readers with the area's best local news coverage, while providing advertisers with unprecedented access to one of the world's most diverse and dynamic audiences.


No matter the distribution vehicle—newspaper, magazine, mobile, online—SCNG's in-depth reporting on local news, politics, sports and entertainment continues to attract a desirable audience for its customers. Combining print, online and social media, SCNG now delivers premium content to over 8.1 million adults every week, making it an indispensable marketing solution for advertisers across Southern California.

Share Your News with the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin


WHAT TO SEND?

  * Local stories — people, places and events — that are unique to the Inland Empire.
  * Club news about meetings, activities, special events and election of officers sponsored by civic, service, fraternal and social organizations.
  * Business news of new enterprises in town, promotions, news employees, changes in hours, services and products.
  * Church news and news of related organizations.
  * School news of student activities, parent-teacher group meetings, school concerts, plays and other events like college honors, graduations, athletics and plays.
  * Sports news about games, team registrations, tournaments and other activities.
  * Programs at parks and libraries, along with other facilities available to the public.
  * Entertainment venues, special events, family activities and other amusements.

WRITING A NEWS RELEASE

  * All news releases should contain the organization’s name and address, along with the name and daytime phone number of the individual to be contacted in case more information is needed.
  * Consider sending an electronic press release via email. Paste the text into the message field rather than sending an attachment that may not be compatible with the programs in use at the Daily Bulletin.
  * Be concise. News releases, as a rule, should not be longer than 1.5 pages, double-spaced.
  * Be aware of submission deadlines. Most publications like material at least two weeks before the event. It can never get there too early.

Entertainment and FEATURES


To suggest features coverage, including healthy lifestyle, food, theater, fine arts, or general entertainment stories, please email entertainment@langnews.com. If the information is related to a specific event, please contact us at least two weeks in advance.


PHOTO


Do you have photos from a community event? Or is there an upcoming event you’d like to see covered visually? Send the details our way. For event coverage, let us know at least two weeks in advance and keep in mind we’re looking for photo opportunities that are not set up just for us. Action is the key.

We encourage coaches to send us varsity game results only. Deadline for the high school game results is 10:30 p.m. on the day of the event, but earlier calls are appreciated. E-mail sports@inlandnewspapers.com, or call 909-483-9368 or 909-483-9362 to report scores.


BUSINESS


Our Business section includes announcements of new businesses and products; deals, mergers and transactions; changes to existing companies; promotions, new hirings and retirements. Business news items must be received at least one week before publication. Business items can be emailed to Samantha Gowen at sgowen@scng.com.


VACATION PHOTOS


The Daily Bulletin is anxious to enjoy its readers’ vacation trips with its regular Daily Bulletin On Vacation feature, publishing photos of readers on vacation holding the newspaper in the photo. We need the full names and hometowns of everyone in the photo as well as information on where it was taken. Two ways to get it to us: mail to 9616 Archibald Ave., #100, Rancho Cucamonga, 91730, or email to citydesk@inlandnewspapers.com. If sending by email, please do not embed the photo in your email but send it as an attachment. Questions? Call 909-483-9382.


SLICE OF WRY


Do you have a suggestion for Slice of Wry? We want to hear it. Email citydesk@inlandnewspapers.com. Please include your name, city of residence, and a number where you can be reached.

OPINION


HOW TO SUBMIT A GUEST COMMENTARY


Los Angeles News Group newspapers consider guest commentary submissions of no more than 600 words.


We look for topical commentary on public policy and social issues that are of general interest to our print and digital readership. We give preference to local, regional and California topics and writers.


The commentary must be the author’s original work. We do not pay for guest commentaries.


Submissions are subject to editing, though we make every effort to retain the author’s voice and point of view. Email your submission to opinion@langnews.com with the subject line “Op-ed submission.” Include a sentence or two at the end including your position, city or community of residence, and any background relevant to your expertise in the topic.


HOW TO SUBMIT A LETTER TO THE EDITOR


We welcome letters to the editor on all issues of public concern. All submissions are subject to editing and condensation, and they can be published only with the writer’s true name. Letters must include the writer’s home community and a daytime phone number for confirmation. Please limit submissions to 150 words and send via email (without attachments) to opinions@inlandnewspapers.com.

PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES PERIODICALLY AND IS EFFECTIVE AS OF MAY 25, 2018.


Digital First Media (“Digital First Media,” “us,” or “we”) is committed to protecting your personal privacy. We provide this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to explain the type of Personal Information (as defined below) we collect on web sites including SMS/Text Alerts and Mobile Web owned by the Digital First Media, such as www.digitalfirstmedia.com (each, a “Web Site”), and our mobile application (the “Application,” together with Web Site, the “Platform”) and how we use Personal Information. As we update and expand our Platform and services, our Policy may change so check back to this page from time to time.


Our Policy applies to Personal Information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, through our Platform, or in other ways such as by phone, by mail, or through other offline and print media. This Policy does not apply to Personal Information collected about you by anyone except us and only applies to the Platform or Web Site to which this Policy is linked.


Types of Information We Collect

Changing Your Personal Information. You may request your Personal Information be updated or changed. Some of our Web Sites may allow you to do so directly. Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law.


Deletion. Digital First Media generally keeps your Personal Information for as long as is required for the purpose it is collected, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. You may, however, request that we delete your Personal Information. We may also decide to delete your Personal Information if we believe it is inaccurate, incomplete, or that our continued use or storage of the information is prohibited by our obligations to other parties. When we delete Personal Information it will be removed from active databases but may remain in archives where it is not practical or possible to delete it. In addition, we may keep your Personal Information as needed to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements.

Protecting Information


No transmission of data over the internet or electronic storage of data is completely secure. Digital First Media takes reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal Information provided to this Platform, but we cannot guarantee that Personal Information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.


In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information may have been compromised, we may notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and we may notify you by any method permitted by law.


Children


Digital First Media does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. No one under age 13 is authorized to provide any Personal Information to us or use our Platform.


Third Party “Linked-To” Web Sites


When you are on our Platform you may have the opportunity to visit, or link to, other web sites not operated by Digital First Media, including other web sites operated by our affiliates, by service vendors, or by unaffiliated third parties. These web sites may collect Personal Information about you. Digital First Media does not control web sites that are operated by these entities and is not responsible for the information practices of these web sites. The privacy policies of web sites operated by other affiliates of Digital First Media are located on those web sites.


Applicant and Employee Information


If you submit an application for employment to or are currently an employee of Digital First Media, Digital First Media collects your Personal Information through your application for employment or during continued employment with Digital First Media, and your submission of employee related documents (collectively “Employee Information”). Examples of Employee Information that may be collected in connection with your employment or application for employment include your name, date of birth, government issued identification, banking information, marital status, health information, benefit information, employment history, education, job qualifications, and other relevant employee personal data. We also collect some of this information about your dependents when you provide it to us when you enroll in health and other benefits or provide contact information. By providing Personal Information about family members or other individuals, you represent that you have their consent to provide this information to us for the purposes set forth in this Policy. Employee Information does not include any Personal Information that is available to the general public and excludes information generally available on a business card.


In accordance with applicable law, Digital First Media may use Employee Information to evaluate applications for employment, manage work-related aspects of the employee-employer relationship (i.e., training, payroll, benefits, travel, reimbursement expenses, performance appraisals, succession planning, team member health and safety), investigate and respond to any claims related to your employment, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Your Employee Information will not be used for direct marketing purposes by us or any third party service provider, unless you specifically consent to such use.


Digital First Media shares your Employee Information with third parties who provide outsourced human resource functions to us. Digital First Media may disclose your Employee Information if required or permitted to do so by law (such as when part of a governmental agency action or litigation), governmental or quasi-governmental requests, or a regulatory organization, or to relevant third parties such as site technicians, brokers, auditors, lawyers, or professional advisors. In the event that Digital First Media considers it necessary or where required by law to disclose Employee Information, we may share your Employee Information with our outside lawyers, law enforcement, or others who are legally authorized. As Digital First Media continues to develop our business, we may buy or sell assets. In the event that Digital First Media or substantially all of our assets are acquired, Employee Information may be one of the transferred assets.

Digital First Media Cookie Policy


Last Updated May 16, 2018


This Cookie Policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies. This Cookie Policy applies to any website that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. For more information on our privacy practices generally please visit our Privacy Policy.


We may change this Cookie Policy at any time. Please take a look at the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last revised. Any changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on or through the Site. Please note that the names and functionality of cookies, pixels and other technologies may change over time.

What is a cookie?


A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables a variety of features and functionality. Cookies also enable you to easily share content and help us serve relevant ads to you. Cookies can do this because websites can read and write them, enabling websites to recognize you and remember important information that will make your use of a website more convenient (for example by remembering preference settings).


Does Digital First Media use cookies?


Yes. We use cookies and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses our websites has the best possible experience and for marketing purposes. Cookies also help us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit our site or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this policy.


When do we place cookies?


We place cookies when you visit our websites or use certain mobile applications. Any web browser visiting these sites will receive cookies from us. We also place cookies in your browser when you visit non Digital First Media sites that host our plugins or tags.


What types of cookies do we use?


We use a variety of cookie types:


  * Preference Cookies.Preference cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember language or other local settings and customize the websites accordingly.

  * Strictly Necessary Cookies.Strictly necessary cookies are necessary for the website to work and to enable you to move around it and to use its features. Without these absolutely necessary cookies, websites will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like it to and we may not be able to provide the Site or certain services or features you request.
  * Social Plug-in Tracking Cookies.Such cookies are used to track members [and non-members] of social media networks for market research analytics, and product development.
  * Analytics Cookies.Analytics cookies collect information about your use of the websites, and enable us to improve the way they work. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on a website, help us record any difficulties you have with a website, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage, rather than the usage of a single person.
  * Advertising Cookies.Advertising cookies are used for marketing purposes. This is discussed below in greater detail.
  * Affiliate Cookies. Some of our websites may contain promotional links to other companies’ sites. If you follow one of these links or interact with that other site, a cookie is used to tell the other site that you came from one of our websites. That other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral. For more information, see the Internet Advertising Bureau’s guide about how affiliate marketing works.

All of the cookies above are either persistent cookies or session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to the website or interact with our services repeatedly. A persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by the website when you return to one of our websites or a partner site that uses our services. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).


What is Do Not Track (DNT)?


DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. No standard has been adopted to date. As such, we do not generally respond to “do not track” signals.


How are cookies used for advertising purposes?


Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They also help us provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. We may use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may employ cookies and clear GIFs to measure advertising effectiveness. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these third party advertising companies if you have any concerns. Note: Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Ads served by us may also set third party cookies.


Unless you clear these cookies from your browser, we may use this information to:

  * provide more relevant, interest-based advertising
  * provide aggregate reports of ads activity to advertisers and websites hosting the ads
  * help website and app owners understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps
  * detect and defend against fraud and other risks to protect users and partners
  * improve our products

Controlling cookies


Most browsers allow you to control and erase cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. Additionally, some features may work improperly or not at all. It may also stop you from saving customized settings. If you want to another way to clean out all cookies left behind by the websites you have visited, here are links where you can download programs that clean out cookies:
