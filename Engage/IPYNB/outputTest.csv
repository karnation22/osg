India WhatsApp rumors: Mob kills man in latest attack, 30 arrested


By Sugam Pokharel and James Griffiths, CNN

Numerous lynchings and mob attacks in India have been linked to rumors spread on WhatsApp.

New Delhi (CNN)Indian police arrested 30 people after a man was lynched by a huge mob incensed by rumors of child kidnapping spread on WhatsApp.

In the latest in a spate of mob killings linked to the Facebook-owned messaging app, Mohammed Azam was attacked, along with three friends in Bidar, in the southern state of Karnataka Friday. His friends were severely injured and are in stable condition in hospital.
According to H. R. Mahadev, Bidar district deputy commissioner, the men were driving in the area when they stopped at the roadside to hand out chocolates to schoolgirls.
One of the children screamed, alarming locals who -- inspired by rumors spread on social media about child kidnapping gangs -- confronted the men and accused them of attempting to abduct the children.
""Why were they handing out chocolates to schoolgirls, we don't know,"" Mahadev said. ""Whether or not they had bad intention, we don't know that yet. We are still investigating.""

The men fled, but were attacked by a mob of around 2,000 people a few miles ahead after messages were sent about them on WhatsApp. The vehicle they were traveling in skidded off the road, after which the mob dragged them out of the car and beat them.
Thirty people have been arrested in connection with the case, 28 for being involved in the violence, and two for spreading false rumors, including the admin of a local WhatsApp group.
G. Parameshwara, deputy chief minister of Karnataka, said he condemned the ""mob lynching"" and urged police to ""take swift action against perpetrators.""
""I urge people not to pay heed to rumors and take the law into your hands. Report suspicious activity to the police,"" he said.
This photo illustration shows an Indian newspaper vendor reading a newspaper with a full back page advertisement from WhatsApp intended to counter fake information, in New Delhi on July 10, 2018.

Nationwide problem

Last week, WhatsApp took out full-page ads in leading English and Hindi newspapers, giving readers 10 tips to spot messages that might be fake.
""Fake news often goes viral"" one of the adverts read. ""Just because a message is shared many times does not make it true.""
The company told CNN it would translate the ads to run in local newspapers in nine Indian states, many of which speak different languages.
WhatsApp's anti-fake news campaign came in the wake of a mob in Maharashtra lynching five people on July 1 after messages spread on the app claimed they were child abductors.
The men, poor agricultural workers from a nearby district, were attacked by a group of about 40 people after they arrived by bus. They were surrounded by a crowd of almost 3,000 people.
WhatsApp messages warning residents of possible kidnappers had been circulating in the area for 10 to 15 days.
This photo taken on July 10, 2018 shows a damaged vehicle in which two men were traveling in Assam when they were attacked by a mob.
On June 8, two men traveling in a SUV were lynched by a mob in the northeastern state of Assam after rumors that a child was being held in the car spread through the local village on social media sites Facebook and WhatsApp. The car was stopped by locals and the men were pulled out and beaten to death.
In May, a transgender woman was killed and three others seriously injured in the city of Hyderabad when they were attacked by a mob of angry locals acting on WhatsApp rumors that the women were child traffickers.
The messages, which went viral in the region, claimed that transgender women were behind a plot to kidnap young children.
A day before the transgender attack, a man with mental health problems was beaten up in Pahadishareef, also in southern Hyderabad, over WhatsApp rumors that he was a member of a kidnap gang.
In a statement after the July 1 attack, the Indian technology ministry said ""the abuse of a platform like WhatsApp for repeated circulation of such provocative content (is) a matter of deep concern.""
WhatsApp said it was ""horrified by these terrible acts of violence"" and announced plans to keep users safe and prevent misuse of the service, including a potential warning against forwarding messages.

Child kidnapping

While the social media panic has led to the death of innocent people, the fear of child kidnapping is not unfounded.
According to India's Ministry of Home Affairs, there was an increase of 30% in kidnapping and child abduction cases from 2015 to 2016, with the total number of cases rising from around 42,000 to over 54,700.
In the latest Trafficking in Persons report from the US State Department, the authors warned that in India ""victim protection remained inadequate and inconsistent, and the government sometimes penalized victims through arrests for crimes committed as a result of being subjected to human trafficking.""
""Experts estimate millions of women and children are victims of sex trafficking in India,"" the report said. Children are also kidnapped and forced to work in mines or on farms.
The report did praise some efforts taken by the Indian government to tackle the issue, including the establishment of help desks in 33 major railway stations to ""provide immediate support to unaccompanied children, who may be missing, abandoned, or runaways and who may be vulnerable to exploitation.""

CNN's Manveena Suri, Rishi Iyengar, Swati Gupta and Bard Wilkinson contributed reporting.

WhatsApp is using newspapers to fight fake news in India

by Rishi Iyengar @Iyengarish July 10, 2018: 1:19 PM ET
Here's why quitting Facebook is so hard

WhatsApp is using old media to tackle its misinformation problem in India.


The messaging service, owned by Facebook (FB), took out full-page ads in leading English and Hindi newspapers on Tuesday, giving readers 10 tips to spot messages that might be fake.


The ads are part of a campaign by WhatsApp in its biggest market following a spate of lynchings that have been blamed on hoaxes sent over the platform.


A spokesperson told CNNMoney that the company would translate the ads to run in local newspapers in nine Indian states, many of which speak different languages.


WhatsApp's tips include checking with other sources, looking up photos online that may be edited, and thinking twice before forwarding a message you have doubts about.


""Fake news often goes viral"" reads one. ""Just because a message is shared many times does not make it true.""


WhatsApp is fighting fake rumors on its platform through full-page ads in major Indian newspapers.

WhatsApp, which has more than 200 million users in India, is also rolling out several new features to stop the spread of fake rumors.


One of those features — a service WhatsApp has been testing in India to label forwarded messages — was launched globally on Tuesday. It shows when a message has been forwarded rather than composed by the sender.

Other big tech firms around the world are also trying to combat misinformation, including Facebook.


YouTube, the hugely popular video platform owned by Google (GOOGL), announced plans on Monday to push videos from more ""authoritative"" sources, particularly when it comes to news content.


Twitter (TWTR) is also taking action, with a report last week saying it suspended 70 million accounts in May.

Incidents involving fake rumors spread via WhatsApp have increased across India in the last month.

New Delhi (CNN)A mob in India lynched five people after rumors spread by WhatsApp messages prompted suspicion that they were child abductors, the latest in a spate of violent crimes linked to the messaging service.

The victims were killed in Dhule district of the western state of Maharashtra on Sunday morning after locals accused them of being part of a gang of ""child lifters,"" police said.
It was the fourth time in recent weeks that WhatsApp messages have inspired deadly attacks in India.
The men, poor agricultural workers from a nearby district, were attacked by a group of about 40 people after they arrived by bus. They were surrounded by a crowd of almost 3,000 people.
WhatsApp messages warning residents of possible kidnappers had been circulating in Dhule for 10 to 15 days.

""Someone starts the rumor and it goes on from there,"" M. Ramkumar, Superintendent of Police, Dhule, told CNN.
""They (the victims) were traveling to different places to ask for alms,"" he added.
A police team reached the area after the lynching took place. Two policemen sustained injuries when the mob turned on the officers, said Ramkumar.
Police confirmed a total of 23 people have been arrested in connection with the incident and police are searching for the remainder of the 40 accused. Those arrested have been charged for murder and rioting.
The police have suspended internet and mobile facilities in Dhule district in an attempt to halt the spread of the false messages.

Nationwide spread

Earlier last week, three people were killed in the northeastern state of Tripura after social media, including WhatsApp, rumors of child abduction.
One of the men who was killed Thursday had been hired by the Tripura administration to make announcements through a loudspeaker and warn residents against fake rumors.
The death of a child during a family dispute earlier in the week had fueled fears of kidnap across the region.

""All over social media, people were sharing (fake images and videos) that child lifters looking for human organs such as kidneys and livers were out in the area to kidnap children,"" said Smriti Ranjan Das, a senior police official to CNN.
On June 8, two men traveling in a SUV were lynched by a mob in the northeastern state of Assam after rumors that a child was being held in the car spread through the local village on social media sites Facebook and WhatsApp. The car was stopped by locals and the men were pulled out and beaten to death.
Indian mob kills transgender woman over fake rumors spread on WhatsApp
In May, a transgender woman was killed and three others seriously injured in the city of Hyderabad when they were attacked by a mob of angry locals acting on WhatsApp rumors that the women were child traffickers.
The messages, which went viral in the region, claimed that transgender women were behind a plot to kidnap young children.
A day before the transgender attack, a man with mental health problems was beaten up in Pahadishareef, also in southern Hyderabad, over WhatsApp rumors that he was a member of a kidnap gang.
Incidents involving fake rumors about child abductors have increased across India in the last month. State governments have begun campaigns to counter rumors mostly spread through WhatsApp groups.
The police in Dhule are running ads in local newspapers and TV channels to create awareness about such false reports.
