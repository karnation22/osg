Specifications:

 - For a valid given report type and date, write a function to check if all the reports are present(i.e check if all reports yield an HTTP ok status code (200)). Do this by 
 	using the Python requests library and doing requests.get on the urls. Then check the status code of the request on the url, and make sure it matches 200. Return a 
	boolean flag delineating if all the reports are present, and a list of non-present (HTTP status code != ok) url links.

 - If the command line arguments are invalid (date and/or report type), throw an error (read up on error handling in Python)
